mecvoy,Isn't the kurzgesagt channel (who made the vaccine video on YouTube) funded by pharmacy companies or something?,I heard this once and was interested if someone knew more.,debate_vaccines
gsfwbuz,Comment,"Yes, it's true. They are funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation to make provaccine videos. They disclose this in the video discription of each video they are funded to make.

This one for example :
https://youtu.be/zBkVCpbNnkU",debate_vaccines
gsgfqec,Comment,"yes they are.

the video in question got funded by the gates foundation:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBkVCpbNnkU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBkVCpbNnkU)

> This video has been supported by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.  

and ""kurzgesagt in a nutshell"" doesn't stop there in regards to propaganda.

they also are pushing the co2 based, negative, man-made climate catastrophe propaganda in this video for example:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbR-5mHI6bo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbR-5mHI6bo)

again financed by gates:

> This video is part of a series about climate change supported by Breakthrough Energy ‚Äì a coalition founded by Bill Gates, that is working to expand clean-energy investment and support the innovations that will lead the world to net-zero carbon emissions.  

and part of the video's research was done by ""ourworldindata"":

> A special thanks to the team at Our World for helping us out with data and research! 

which is again gates foundation controlled:

if you are not aware, bill gates is a huge part of the pharma industry specifically in regards to vaccines. he owns a bunch of vaccine companies and has his tentacles in lots of horrible projects, which includes for example paralyzing 490000 through vaccines in india:

[https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/government-corruption/gates-globalist-vaccine-agenda-a-win-win-for-pharma-and-mandatory-vaccination/](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/news/government-corruption/gates-globalist-vaccine-agenda-a-win-win-for-pharma-and-mandatory-vaccination/)

so gates foundation = pharma industry. for a lot of people here this is basic knowledge, but for you or someone you talk to, this may not be the case, so i thought i mention it with a referenced article.

if you want to know who bill gates himself truly is, then i suggest you watch this excellent documentary:

[https://www.corbettreport.com/gates/](https://www.corbettreport.com/gates/) (available for free on your favorite video platform or as free download)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

but it doesn't even end there.

their german channel is a funk channel:

[https://www.youtube.com/c/KurzgesagtDE/about](https://www.youtube.com/c/KurzgesagtDE/about)

funk is basically the digital arm of the german state propaganda broadcast organisations.

which is financed through coercion btw to the point, where they are even throwing people into prison, who don't have any broadcasting devices, yet through criminal legislation the criminals are still trying to coerce those people into paying for propaganda:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0DH5nn4zIc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0DH5nn4zIc) (german video)

if you want to see one of the clearest examples, that kurzgesagt is just pure propaganda, then  this video is nailing it:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_hcvUfc2Lww](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_hcvUfc2Lww) (use english subs as the video is german)

in this video a youtube channel financed by the public german broadcasting propaganda networks  is telling you, that the theft done on the public is fine  (gez money) and that overall  it is really important, the state financed propaganda broadcasting system exists.

so this is literally the state propaganda arm financing online propaganda to reduce the boycotting and fight against the criminal GEZ stolen money.

that is how objective kurzgesagt is :D

if you actually live in germany and  want actual information about the fucked up coercion in regards to the public propaganda broadcasting networks, then this website can be a great start:

[https://www.rundfunk-frei.de/](https://www.rundfunk-frei.de/)

so overall kurzgesagt as a whole is  not only getting financed by pharma, but also is getting directly financed/run by governments (the german version is a funk channel).

this also explains why seemingly every 3rd video is pushing the great reset in one way or another.

i hope this was what you asked for.

it is important to understand, that these videos  with the lie of objective research behind them are extremely effective propaganda tools.

that is why traitor governments and mass murdering monsters like gates and his friends want control over them, because they want to push their agendas through them or prime the public to accept them.

and i hope, that now you can show anyone, who links this video to you as ""evidence"", that this is just a pharma advertisement video and NOT an objectively researched video.

i would also suggest to you, to always refer to it as a pharma advertisement video or propaganda video.

language is very powerful and honest language can be very powerful.

alright now that should be it. all the references you could need for yourself or to make said case in a discussion with others :)",debate_vaccines

gsh51dc,Comment,"The correct takeaway is that the vaccines aren't working. The efficacy is lower than the massaged data from the pharma companies and variants are being created by them and are evading them.

Unfortunately, what we'll be told is that it's because not enough people have been vaccinated so we need to step up the speed and breadth of the process. Also, don't fear, because improved versions are coming that will handle the variants - lather, rinse, repeat.

Reality is the vaccines only keep the hospitalization rates down, temporarily, and may slow spread by keeping coughing and sneezing at bay. No immunity is conferred and ability to infect still exists. With vaccine-induced variants, the pandemic will be extended instead of contained.

Magnesium chloride hexahydrate
Polysorbate 80

There are many examples of vaccinated people catching and spreading the disease they have been vaccinated against.  Here is [one](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00000359.htm) example.

2. A much lower death rate for what?  What are people dying from that vaccines can prevent, specifically today in America?

I think you are mistaken. Efficacy, in vaccines, is measured in terms of number of cases reduced. I.e. control group has 100 cases, vaccine group has 5. That's 95% efficacy. Doesn't mean nobody will catch the virus, it means 95% of the people will not catch the virus after vaccination. That is how vaccines work. Efficacy rate of 95% means 95% of the population won't catch the virus.

If you are talking about herd immunity, you don't need 100% immunity. The whole point is to cut off transmission links. Ever heard of R knot? That is how many people will get infected from a single patient. R-knot of this virus is about 2-4, which means 1 infected person will give the virus to 2-4 people on average. 75% immunity is good enough to prevent major outbreaks we are seeing.

And please explain how sanitation and clean water fails to stop flu with a R-knot of 2, but can stop measles which has a R-knot of 12-20.",debate_vaccines

How do you figure that. Every single person who dies is in that pool. All of them. Covid vaccine mortality deniers seek to rule out covid vaccines before the pool is even examined.

> One of these figures can be accounted for by people who would die anyway. One isn't.

Neither can actually. This is why clinical trials are used. Observational data does not help you here. However the clinical data is already compromised, as the samples were biased towards healthy people.

> Also how do you account for the huge increase in excess deaths, in line with the pandemic infections?

And also inline with political mishandling of a non pandemic.

Or increased them, less regular medical care etc, normal flu cases being afraid to seek help from the fear mongering, leading to increased death from normal shit that would have been dealt with. How many

Two orders of magnitude. We went from ones to hundreds, not from tens to hundreds, so two orders of magnitude, not one. Not a trivial error. It shows your entire orientation is off.

2% of 7.9 billion is 158 million. Global covid mortality is 2.7 million. We cannot agree that covid kills 2% globally.

Just in time for natural herd immunity to take over you mean? This is why we have clinical trials. To iron out those variables. Anything could account for this. Did cancer treatment resume yet.

Hopefully there's someone here familiar enough with Sinovac / immune research; TIA for any answers.

> The three most advanced vaccines (from Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna) all work by getting our own cells to make copies of the virus spike protein. The Oxford vaccine [as well as Sputnik-V] achieves this by introducing the spike protein gene via a harmless adenovirus vector. The other two vaccines deliver the spike protein gene directly as mRNA wrapped in a nanoparticle. When our own cells make the spike protein, our immune response will recognize it as foreign and start making antibodies and T cells that specifically target it.

> However, the SARS-CoV-2 virus is more complicated than just a spike protein. There are, in fact, four different proteins that form the overall structure of the virus particle: spike, envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). In a natural infection, our immune system recognizes all of these proteins to varying degrees. So how important are immune responses to these different proteins, and does it matter that the first vaccines will not replicate these?

> Following SARS-CoV-2 infection, researchers have discovered that we actually make the most antibodies to the N protein ‚Äì not the spike protein.

The devil is in the details. The one trial I looked at, the pfizer trial showed PCR confirmed covid was less in the vaccinated, but clinical sickness of covid symptoms was higher in the vaccinated. Pfizer has been asked to provide the raw data to settle this anomaly, but has not done that so far.

The bias is in the sample. The sample for the trial included only those people least likely to have a vaccine reaction. People with conditions expected to make them vulnerable to vaccine reactions were excluded from the trial, so the sample does not represent the population it is drawn from, and extrapolations of from the sample data to the general population are not warranted given this bias. Large classes of people were excluded from participating in the trial that are now not being warned that their safety has not been determined by the trial data, as people with their conditions were excluded from the trial. The wording of the pfizer documents makes it clear they could exclude any person from the trial for any reason. This is absolutely not a random unbiased sample that can be generalized to the population it is drawn from.",debate_vaccines

gsc6rcm,Comment,"It's kind of impossible to talk about one without talking about the other as the effectiveness of a medical treatment is tied up with the idea of the medical treatment not harming you. It is all well and good for you to quote effectiveness numbers for a narrow measure like reduces covid, but without also considering the price people pay to avoid covid this is misleading. This point is centrial to the anti vax message. You might ask me am I okay with letting covid run it's course in a population when we have a vaccine that is 95% effective at preventing it, but unless you can prove the vaccine is also safe, that effectiveness figure is meaningless. An effective vaccine is necessarily also a safe vaccine. A vaccine that 100% prevents covid, but happens to be more dangerous than covid, is not an effective medical treatment.",debate_vaccines

How safe is the question.  Ultimately your need to consider the patients person risk of long term side effects from said virus vs long term side effects of the vaccine. 
Neither of wich are very easy to determine, partially because of all the financial incentives for covid diagnosis, and highly suspicious tests. Then financial incentives for big pharma, and no long term studies.
Overall ya their probably safe for the vast majority of people. If safety means not dying, but then again so is covid. It depends on the individual, and the needs of the individual should be assessed on a case by case basis.

we got the claim, that using poison drugs on people who were told to have ""aids""  was a great choice, which it wasn't and isn't.

for those not aware,  children and adults were poisoned  with AZT, which is a blackbox chemo drug.

AZT is to this day murdering healthy children, after some pieces of shit told them, that their child is ""hiv-positive"", which has much meaning as a positive pcr covid-19 ""test"". (this means, that it has none)

i suggest starting research into the aids hoax  by watching the documentary

""house of numbers: anatomy of an epidemic"" from 2009.

next we have the insane unfounded claim, that the ""covid-19 vaccines"", better called experimental genetic modification injections, are safe and were proven safe and that they got approved by the fda.

that is NOT the case.

an emergency use authorization is NOT a real approval of a medication or vaccine.

and as far as i know, NO ""covid-19 vaccine"" got approved thus far by the fda.

in regards to safety,  NO proper longterm safety studies are done at all.

longterm proper safety studies are REQUIRED to claim, that any medication or vaccine is safe.

so NO claim about safety can be made without those.

HOWEVER, we already have vaers data showing lots of death, facial paralysis and more as a result of the poison injections called ""covid-19 vaccines"":

[https://www.openvaers.com/covid-data](https://www.openvaers.com/covid-data)

important to note here, that the 1739 deaths reported to vaers IN NO WAY represent the actual number for the usa.

a harvard pilgrim healthcare investigation found, that only less than 1% of adverse events are getting reported to vaers, so are we looking at 173900 deaths already?

maybe yes, maybe no. maybe people got more aware of vaers these days.

what we do know however, that any claim of safety is nonsense.

in regards to effectiveness, one can look at this nice breakdown done by the highwire, that shows how those insane effectiveness claims are coming from:

[https://thehighwire.com/videos/a-vaccine-on-the-horizon/](https://thehighwire.com/videos/a-vaccine-on-the-horizon/) (minute 10-30)

you also can dumpster all over those garbage ""effectiveness"" ""studies"" by just pointing out, that there is no covid-19 test PERIOD:

this is an external peer review of the first paper claiming to have created a covid-19 test.

this paper turned out to be a complete dumpster fire, that should NEVER have gotten published and should get immediately retracted.

so this video is just pure garbage.

the most terrifying part about this however is the blind trust in traitor governments, that it carries  and the literal glorification of:

There is no contagion. Germs are ubiquitous with humans.

Winter does not increase spread from being indoors--this is a complete lie by the medical industry. Below is what actually happens.

The body is signaled to dump mass stored toxins. This occurs at the cellular level. Climate/seasonal changes bring about humidity and temperature changes which increase bioactive functions of cells, through moisture and/or oxygen absorption. These biochemical signals cause cells to release stored toxins‚Äîit is cellular processes being maintained through cell survival mechanisms; a sort of house cleaning. Bacterium also increases during colder months, as they flourish in the blood due to a lowered bodily temperature. When they proliferate, they feed upon debris in the tissue and blood.¬†

When they consume such matter, they excrete it into a utilizable form for white blood cells and other cleansing cells, such as phagocytes, to further eliminate and or recycle for use by the body. The body discards 90% of toxins through the skin. The rest expel via the bowels, mouth, and mucus membranes. Depending upon the toxicity and nature of those substances, parasites or fungus may be utilized to help break them down. But when substances are too toxic for these living microbial agents to consume without dying, a non-living agent must be created by the body as a last resort. These are called viruses; enzymatic-like agents that break apart specific matter. They dissolve waste matter when tissue is too toxic for our living microbes to consume and eliminate.¬†

There are over 300,000 viral strains to the human body alone. Viruses are created by the cell as solvents for material bacteria can not decompose. The cell controls what goes in and out of it--nothing may enter without the cell choosing so (viruses are solvents and never contagious).

We may observe the Illusion of Viral Activity, because all living organisms‚Äîbe they plants, or animals‚Äîfunction with biological clocks alongside nature. When trees blossom, it is because temperature and climatic changes are causing that tree to produce fruit. In the microlevel of the body, the same is true. The body is the microcosm of the outer macrocosm (universe) we observe.¬†

A person may experience viral or bacterial detoxifications regularly if they continually toxify their body. Even in healthy people, we can expect to have mild colds every so often. Bacterial colds are necessary to help us break down toxins we may have picked up from air, food, or water sources. They also serve to strengthen the overall body.¬†",debate_vaccines

> We have reviewed the preliminary assessment of the primary analysis and the results were consistent with the interim analysis.  

(To be fair; Not really surprising they'd deny it though.)",debate_vaccines
grxpeg8,Comment,"Federal health officials said Tuesday that the encouraging results that AstraZeneca announced about its Covid-19 vaccine may have been based on outdated and incomplete information about the vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness, an extraordinary blow to the credibility of an already embattled vaccine.

In a statement released shortly after midnight, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that an independent panel of medical experts that has been helping to oversee AstraZeneca‚Äôs U.S. trial had ‚Äúexpressed concern that AstraZeneca may have included outdated information from that trial, which may have provided an incomplete view of the efficacy data.‚Äù

The public airing of a conflict between a pharmaceutical company and a board overseeing a clinical trial is highly unusual. It is almost certain to trigger extra scrutiny of the vaccine by the Food and Drug Administration and other regulators if AstraZeneca seeks emergency authorization of its vaccine in the United States

‚ÄúThis is really what you call an unforced error,‚Äù Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation‚Äôs leading infectious-disease expert, said on ‚ÄúGood Morning America‚Äù on Tuesday morning. ‚ÄúBecause the fact is: This is very likely a very good vaccine, and this kind of thing does, as you say, do nothing but really cast some doubt about the vaccines and maybe contributes to the hesitancy.‚Äù

The friction with the independent monitoring board revolved around how AstraZeneca was determining whether participants in the clinical trial had possible or actual cases of Covid-19, according to a person familiar with the situation. The independent monitoring board twice pushed AstraZeneca to take a more rigorous approach, telling the company it had sufficient information to determine how many trial participants had the disease. That had the potential to reduce the vaccine‚Äôs apparent effectiveness.

But AstraZeneca unveiled its interim results on Monday without conducting the full analysis the board requested, possibly casting its vaccine in an overly favorable light.

AstraZeneca defended the data it released on Monday, which it said showed the vaccine was 79 percent effective at preventing Covid-19. The company said on Tuesday that the interim results appeared to be ‚Äúconsistent‚Äù with more recent data collected during the trial. AstraZeneca said it would immediately share its latest efficacy data with the monitoring board. The company said it would reissue fuller results within 48 hours.

The results that AstraZeneca announced on Monday were a badly needed dose of good news, especially because they came at a moment when concerns about the vaccine‚Äôs safety had led more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, to temporarily suspend the shot‚Äôs use over concerns about possible rare side effects. The results not only affirmed the vaccine‚Äôs safety, but also made the vaccine look more effective than it appeared in earlier trials.

But members of the independent monitoring board were surprised by the company‚Äôs announcement. ‚ÄúThey got concerned and wrote a rather harsh note to them and with a copy to me, saying that in fact they felt that the data that was in the press release were somewhat outdated and might in fact be misleading a bit and wanted them to straighten it out,‚Äù said Dr. Fauci, who runs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

That prompted the overnight statement from the infectious-disease institute, which is part of the National Institutes of Health.

Companies sponsoring drug or vaccine trials typically wait for the monitoring board to review analyses and conclude that the study has yielded an answer before they announce trial results.

Company executives do not see the results of the study until the monitoring board reports their study data back to the company. The monitoring board ultimately conveyed the results of the study to AstraZeneca in a meeting over the weekend, leading to the company‚Äôs announcement Monday morning.

The monitoring board‚Äôs slow progress fueled concerns among federal officials that AstraZeneca may have been sitting on the data or that the monitoring board had concerns about the way the data it was reviewing had been presented.

An AstraZeneca spokeswoman, whom the company declined to name, said on Friday that it was ‚Äúcompletely incorrect‚Äù that the trial data had formatting problems or had not been submitted to the monitoring board in a clean fashion.

‚ÄúAs is often the case,‚Äù the spokeswoman said, monitoring boards ‚Äúcan request new or clarifying analyses of data from the trial. This would enable them to ensure the robustness of their determinations.‚Äù

The national institute‚Äôs statement, issued shortly after midnight, stunned experts. Dr. Eric Topol, a clinical trials expert at Scripps Research in San Diego, said it was ‚Äúhighly irregular‚Äù to see such a public display of friction between a monitoring board and a study sponsor, which are typically in close concordance.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so, so troubling.‚Äù

AstraZeneca‚Äôs relationship with the U.S. authorities has been fraught since last year, when senior health officials believed the company was not being forthright about the design of its clinical trials, its results and safety issues. That skepticism carried over to last week, when senior officials at a number of federal health agencies grew suspicious about why AstraZeneca had not announced data from its U.S. study..",debate_vaccines

grxt39h,Comment,"TL;DR

The report, described as ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù and ‚Äúbizarre‚Äù by other senior scientists,  
[..]  
Jeremy Brown, from UCL and a member of the government‚Äôs Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said this was ‚Äúridiculous‚Äù. He pointed to the now extensive real-world data showing the vaccines were safe and reduced deaths. ‚ÄúIt is quite conclusively true that the vaccine offers protection in the real world,‚Äù he said. Far from killing people, he said, ‚Äúif you‚Äôve been vaccinated you have around an 85 per cent lower chance of ending up in hospital‚Äù.  

[..]  

The rise in deaths was caused by infections, he said, rather than vaccines.
He added that academics should not be endorsing the idea vaccines may be causing mass death. ‚ÄúThe only way out of this mess is the vaccine so anything that undermines that is distinctly unhelpful,‚Äù he said.
Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, added that to make the link ‚Äúshows a blatant disregard for the facts‚Äù and ‚Äúis irresponsible in the extreme‚Äù.  

[..]  

Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said the report was ‚Äúthe reverse of science‚Äù and ‚Äúbizarre‚Äù, adding that the authors ‚Äúseem to have worked backwards, deploying only research findings which fit their ideology, or they simply don‚Äôt bother with anything so inconvenient‚Äù.
‚ÄúThe smearing of some of the current vaccines is particularly egregious,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt seems calculated to grab attention and frighten people, it could cost lives if anyone were foolish enough to believe it.‚Äù",debate_vaccines

1.		It‚Äôs not a vaccine. A vaccine by definition provides immunity to a disease. This does not provide immunity to anything. In a best-case scenario, it merely reduces the chance of getting a severe case of a virus if one catches it. Hence, it is a medical treatment, not a vaccine. I do not want to take a medical treatment for an illness I do not have.
2.		The drug companies, politicians, medical establishment, and media have joined forces to universally refer to this as a vaccine when it is not one, with the intention of manipulating people into feeling safer about undergoing a medical treatment. Because they are being deceitful, I do not trust them, and want nothing to do with their medical treatment.
3.		The presumed benefits of this medical treatment are minimal and would not last long in any case. The establishment acknowledges this, and is already talking about additional shots and ever-increasing numbers of new ‚Äúvaccines‚Äù that would be required on a regular basis. I refuse to turn myself into a chronic patient who receives injections of new pharmaceutical products on a regular basis simply to reduce my chances of getting a severe case of a virus that these injections do not even prevent.
4.		I can reduce my chances of getting a severe case of a virus by strengthening my immune system naturally. In the event I catch a virus, there are vitamins and well-established drugs that have had wonderful results in warding off the illness, without the risks and unknowns of this medical treatment.
5.		The establishment insists that this medical treatment is safe. They cannot possibly know this because the long-term effects are entirely unknown, and will not be known for many years. They may speculate that it is safe, but it is disingenuous for them to make such a claim that cannot possibly be known. Because they are being disingenuous, I do not trust them, and I want no part of their treatment.
6.		The drug companies have zero liability if anything goes wrong, and cannot be sued. Same for the politicians who are pushing this treatment. I will not inject myself with a new, experimental medical device when the people behind it accept no liability or responsibility if something goes wrong. I will not risk my health and my life when they refuse to risk anything.
7.		Israel‚Äôs Prime Minister has openly admitted that the Israeli people are the world‚Äôs laboratory for this experimental treatment. I am not interested in being a guinea pig or donating my body to science.
8.		Israel agreed to share medical data of its citizens with a foreign drug company as a fundamental part of their agreement to receive this treatment. I never consented for my personal medical data to be shared with any such entity, nor was I even asked. I will not contribute to this sleazy enterprise.

gry8qqu,Comment,"‚ÄúSo how much money do doctors really make from vaccines? The average American pediatrician has 1546 patients, though some pediatricians see many more. The vast majority of those patients are very young, perhaps because children transition to a family physician or stop visiting the doctor at all as they grow up. As they table above explains, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays pediatricians $400 per fully vaccinated child. If your pediatrician has just 100 fully-vaccinated patients turning 2 this year, that‚Äôs $40,000. Yes, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays your doctor a $40,000 bonus for fully vaccinating 100 patients under the age of 2. If your doctor manages to fully vaccinate 200 patients, that bonus jumps to $80,000. V But here‚Äôs the catch: Under Blue Cross Blue Shield‚Äôs rules, pediatricians lose the whole bonus unless at least 63% of patients are fully vaccinated, and that includes the flu vaccine. So it‚Äôs not just $400 on your child‚Äôs head‚Äìit could be the whole bonus. To your doctor, your decision to vaccinate your child might be worth $40,000, or much more, depending on the size of his or her practice.

If your pediatrician recommends that your child under the age of 2 receive the flu vaccine‚Äìeven though the flu vaccine has never been studied in very young children and evidence suggests that the flu vaccine actually weakens a person‚Äôs immune system over the long term‚Äìask yourself: Is my doctor more concerned with selling me vaccines to keep my child healthy or to send his child to private school?‚Äù

It is a disgrace that American Doctors don't put patient wellbeing at the front of the queue (which is entirely driven by the healthcare model chosen in America).

So let's have a look at a system, where patient wellbeing is put first. Every renowned nationalised healthcare system.

They all also offer vaccines for free. Why because it is cheaper for them to vaccinate (those who aren't immuno-compromised and aren't allergic to any vaccine contents) than to treat the conditions the vaccines prevent. Yes, they pay the cost of the vaccine AND the cost of any potential aftercare because it is so overwhelmingly better for both the patients and the cost of providing their care.

Just cause some one gets a paper published does NOT mean that you should automatically agree with it.

I usually have to read a study a couple times, think about it, read it again, and then hopefully I possess an understanding of what he study intended to do, how they ran the study and WHY came to the conclusions that they did.



So I go to read the first paper by the sociopath above, 

The paper claimed to be a ""scientific"" study looking at how vaccinations effect the finances of doctors private practices in the USA.
Keep in Mind this paper is written by the CDC.


This sentence from the paper tells you everything 
""Results: Thirty-four practices responded to the survey.""

Let's read between the lines, the CDC sent out a voluntary survey to private practices across the country asking them to share their intimate finances.

34 practices or doctors offices across the country responded.


If were behaving in some morally questionable behaviors that allowed you to earn some extra income so you can pay off your med school debt a year early, would you willingly send your finances to the CDC?

Well some of the practices did send the CDC their finances and found,
""More than one half of the respondents broke even or suffered financial losses from vaccinating patients""

The pharma-charity link is mainstream. 

No, the patient in UK has no right to choose. He is forced to pay for NHS (indirectly). There is no option what to pay. The same goes in US. You are forced to pay there medicare. Different names mean nothing.

&#x200B;

> I can pick any brand I want if I have a preference. 

No it's a monopolized drug market. You can choose on a free market not in monopolies. Here is the contrast. If you are supplementing for example. You could choose supplements from pfizer, yeah? But they are crap (and I do heavy supplementation, so I can compare because the market is open). Now if a company creates crappy supplements (which you find in dollarstore, poundstore, eurostore etc) why they would ever create proper drugs? Without the medical market being monopolized these companies would been out of business for selling crap. Or they would start getting serious about creating good substances.

Now charities have many times useful stuff and they do contribute to palliative care for people but only under drugging. So I am against a monopolistic business model like this. And NHS is in that category. I don't care if NHS promotes allopathy or homeopathy or naturopathy. My reaction is exactly the same, regardless of discipline in medicine. And even regardless whether it works or not. The free options are not there. And you can't prove me wrong.",debate_vaccines

I assume you don't buy any food as the way it is produced is highly regulated to ensure safety. It's a monopoly! You probably should just eat the grass outside as that's the only way you'll have free choice. 

As I've said, the vaccines are available to be tested, the fact you don't have the means to test it is your problem. It isn't secret. My friend who works at the local university is testing some of the yet to be released vaccines at the moment. He receives no money for doing this from the supplier, it's funded as a research grant.

He's been sent boxes full for running all kinds of tests to determine safety and effectiveness and his independent info will be published and added to numerous other publications and ultimately if most of these point to them being good, the UK may then decide to put it through the official safety checks/organise trials to see if it can be used in public.",debate_vaccines

Untested by whom? Plus you can have your tested medicine. Our difference is you want me to follow your ideas. I don't want to take what you take. The drug system is a monopoly. If you can't find something retail and yet it is proposed for mass consumption yeah it is a monopoly.

&#x200B;

>I assume you don't buy any food as the way it is produced is highly regulated to ensure safety.

I don't see safety like that. First of all safety is useless if what you buy doesn't do the job. What's the point of safety. The more you eat the sooner you die.  That's how it goes. It's not a philosophy. Now having my taxes invested in overeating is unhealthy and that's what the government promotes. I don't need you to GMO lettuce and force it to me according to your ""safety standards"". That's a scam.

You mean a pharma grant. I asked the simplest of questions. How do you reverse skin damage caused by vaccines. You don't know. I also asked. How many cells are affected from a single vaccine shot? Again you don't know. How can you compare a vaccine with nutrient supplements? I know the supplements I take they do work on various levels. The difference is they are available vs vaccine drugs that are not. Now you are coming along with zero research and try to claim vaccines are better only because you are paid to claim it.

It is extremely difficult (nigh impossible) to change someone's genes. This is because each 1 of the billions of cells in your body has their own copy of your genes. You'd have to a multitude of things.
1) Disable the immune system completely to allow a carrier to infect and insert the DNA code into each and every cell.
2) Stave off multiple other infectious organisms at the same time that could kill cells before penetration could occur
3) Develop a carrier that can withstand and recognize all cells in the human body and penetrate their membranes.
4) most importantly, the carrier has to also be able to  evade, resist, or kill any microorganisms that would possibly hunt and consume it.

In summary, the human body is far too complex to do this sort of ""gene therapy"" on one person alone, let alone the at least 300 million people in the U.S. and over 7 billion worldwide, as each person can have differing microbiota and cellular membranes.

And yes it is troubling that autoimmune disorders are so prevalent. They can be caused by a multitude of pathogens that are often very difficult for the body to fight off or by cancer and chemotherapy.

And because of human complexity, that's why we take allergies into account and are cautious about administering to certain individuals.

Sorry for the rant, just had a lot to say.

So, to start off. Your statement needs a correction... you definitely know of somebody who's died with disease, and with a virus, but not from a PATHOGENIC virus.

Simply, Association/Correlation does not equal Causation. What do I mean...

Just because ICE cars and EV cars both have windows does not mean that windows propel both cars. Or better, just because vultures are always present at a carrion does NOT mean they killed the creature. Vultures are scavengers not hunters. And its the same with viruses (or any germ). Germs are present wherever disease is because disease brings on germs but germs do not cause disease. Viruses are harmless. They are manufactured by our cells. Thats why germs, such as viruses, are also found in healthy bodies (what they confusingly term 'asymptomatic' bodies).

Also, people are dying, YES, no disagreement there. In fact, its very important that people realise this because the true cause of death is not a pathogenic virus, of which NONE in history have ever been proven to exist.

There are many reasons and explanations to explain how we know that to be true however I would never be able to provide all such info just here. Its too much evidence and explanation. But I can provide you the core facts and concepts to wake you up....

1st, Dr. Stefan Lanka in 2015/16 in German Court disproved the Measles virus, one of history's most common ""viruses"" which even you and I have been inoculated against, read his article explaining the case and how he disproved the Measles ""virus"": [https://wissenschafftplus.de/uploads/article/Dismantling-the-Virus-Theory.pdf](https://wissenschafftplus.de/uploads/article/Dismantling-the-Virus-Theory.pdf) . Take your time perusing it because its vitally important you  understand how he did so. And in case you think his successful attempts were meaningless or fruitless, remember this, the premier Robert Koch Institute to this day (5 years later) has still not been able to contradict Dr. Stefan Lanka.

2nd, the Australian Perth Group ([http://www.theperthgroup.com/whatargued.html](http://www.theperthgroup.com/whatargued.html)) which is a group of scientific and medical PROFESSIONALS has for many years stated that AIDS/HIV has never been demonstrated to exist. That link contains their case.

3rd, if you really want to find out the truth about viruses and how they actually work then you can start here...[https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fcjwrg/the\_deception\_of\_virology\_vaccines\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/fcjwrg/the_deception_of_virology_vaccines_why/) and also watch this...[https://youtu.be/HfNGqWNlamg](https://youtu.be/HfNGqWNlamg) \- 'Ep.36 | Some quotations to refute Germ Theory | IMPORTANT | Adrian'.

4th, these big Pharma companies know the truth but they won't say anything. If you read through Moderna's own webpage here, [https://www.modernatx.com/mrna-technology/science-and-fundamentals-mrna-technology](https://www.modernatx.com/mrna-technology/science-and-fundamentals-mrna-technology) you will see that they say ""these instructions direct cells in the body to make proteins to prevent or fight disease."" which is exactly what we ""conspiracy theorists"" have been saying before Moderna et al. mentioned this. Viruses are harmless pieces of protein manufactured by your cells... ""The general public have been told that we do not become ill except when germs penetrate into from without. The germ theory of disease is ridiculous"" - 'Bechamp Or Pasteur, A Lost Chapter In The History Of Biology', E. Douglas Hume .

5th, and last, disease is actually a multi-factor issue. The quality of air, food, water, and level of activity you possess. If all these things are poor then disease occurs. But the global medical establishment doesn't want us to know that our health is in our hands. They want us to believe that only they have the remedy to help us. But the problem is the global medical establishment is ALLOPATHIC, which means they treat disease (signs of illness) not the cause of disease. And therefore they cannot restore your FULL health like naturopaths can.

\[edit: the SINGLE greatest factor causing COVID like symptoms today is the proliferation of Electro Magnetic Frequencies being emitted by our cellphones, cell towers and other electronic gadgets...""the greatest polluting element in the earth's environment is the proliferation of electromagnetic fields. I consider that to be a far greater threat on a global scale than warming, or the increase of chemical elements in the environment"" Robert O Becker, Nobel prize nominee.

On your last point, the reason I mentioned how viruses work is because the whole premise of Vaccinology is based upon Germ theory, that germs cause disease, when in fact that theory is FLAWED, therefore Vaccinology too is flawed.

Joe Biden: ""I've decided my VP will be qualified first by being born a female PoC, and qualified second by actual objective merit"". 

btw, did you know that merit-based promotions are white privilege in disguise, because presumably whites inherently have more merit? liberal logic. 

so then Joe Biden promotes this woke thing into a highly visible position of authority.

understanding leftists:

you must understand, that they love the idea of government. they love the idea of having policemen, and firemen, and soldiers, and sailors, and welfare office workers, and school teachers, and...

and so their first and foremost priority is to gain and maintain the consent of the governed, and to have the governed have trust and confidence in government institutions. 

so, for example, if they put an authority figure like Dr Fauci on TV, and he tells you to wear a mask, the leftist wants you to immediately put on a mask without question. 

so its important to have authoritative people in those positions, so that when they say something, the people will listen. 

but when you put a ""female PoC"" in as VP, people no longer see that VP position as authoritative, and just see her as a post turtle.

and when you put some clown in as a health authority, the people no longer see that position as authoritative, and will probably reject anything it says.

this is problematic, because while these post turtles are only temporary in their positions,

The article explains the possible integration pathways from RNA into the DNA from an mRNA vaccine application and side effects in particular:

*...if the mRNA from the vaccine (or subsegments thereof) were to make its  way into a transcriptionally-active region of our genome through a  retro-integration process, it will cause our cells to produce an  over-abundance of Spike protein, rather than N protein. Our immune  system does make antibodies to both N and S proteins, but it is the  Spike protein which is the prime target for our immune system because it exists on the outside of the virus. If our cells become permanent (rather than temporary) Spike Protein producing factories due to  permanent alteration of our genomic DNA, this could lead to serious  autoimmune problems.* 

Basically permanent autoimmune conditions. I posted few months ago an earlier article and explanation of this.

So instead of retracting the admitted fraud, in 2014 the CDC decided to double-down, and claim (without evidence) that the reason vaccines are linked to autism is because autism causes vaccines

The CDC could not show where a single child in their study had ever attended any special needs pre-school, or was vaccinated because of that preschool.

The CDC went on to claim (without evidence) that their fraudulent study had been properly replicated (per the scientific method) which appears to be another false statement, since nobody can find the newer studies that replicated the fraudulent CDC study.

And instead of Snopes admitting the CDC whistleblower claim was true, Snopes decided to call it ‚Äúfalse‚Äù based on something someone else did with the data that the CDC decided fo omit.

https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bad-medicine/

And instead of addressing the facts that the CDC whistleblower disclosed, the notorious pro-vaccine shill Dr David Gorski went for the ad hominem attack, and said Dr William Thompson was ‚Äúanti-vaccine‚Äù, as if that somehow makes Thompson less credible.

now, what is fascinating about this case study, is just how easily vaccine cult victims can slip in and out of a state of profound mental retardation. 

they will predictably

1) choose not to acknowledge any info that they suspect might be inconvenient to their vaccine cult dogma 

2) make wild assumptions, based on nothing, and in the face of any and all conflicting info.

for example, they will disregard the fact that live flu virus was just sprayed up her nose, 

and they will disregard the fact that she was just *preparing for the upcoming flu season*, 

and they will insist she must have gotten the flu from somewhere else, other than the live virus that was just sprayed up her nose, 

and they will insist the vaccine is just ""less effective"" than other vaccines, and flat out refuse to admit the nasal flu vaccine killed this girl.  

so just how profound is the selective mental retardation among vaccine cult victims?

>to have the genetic disorder autism? 

autism isn't ""genetic"" per se, 

its just that some people have a ""genetic"" predisposition to having an adverse reaction to a vaccine. 

and sometimes vaccines can cause the genetic damage or mutations, that might manifest as symptoms of ASD. 

if autism was truly ""genetic"", then they could do a gene test for autism, and they can't. 

what they do have is a long list of genes that are known to have been mutated by vaccines.

>The reason we see more autism is because we are not only better at identifying this shit

they have been making this dubious claim for over 40 years, 

and yet nobody can really point to any revolutionary new tests, tools, training, education, etc 

they just claim to be getting better and better at diagnosing autism, year after year, for 40 years, for no particular reason.  

>but also because since vaccines stopped kids from getting deadly deseases most of the time, the natural selection of humans is pretty fucked. 

billions of years of human evolution, and as soon as some wacky vaccine cult comes along, you assume vaccines are necessary for survival of the fittest, and successful human evolution 

billions of species of life on the planet, and not a single species needs any vaccines, except for the one species that invented all the vaccines.

right. 

and triggering an immune reaction isn't safe, even if you assume it to be safe. 


>If you mean the ""vaxx injuries"", that's a different matter. A vaccine is very much still a medication, which CAN have side effects, 

its logical to assume that the long list of unintended side effects are just as common as handful of intended primary effects.  

>but developers try to reduce these as much as possible. 

they can't get around the root problem, which is that vaccines are designed specifically to cause an immune response.  

>maybe you're allergic to a part of the medicine; ok then you shouldn't take it. But sometimes this happens. It doesn't mean that the medication is dangerous.

maybe vaccines actually ""cause"" so-called ""allergies"", and allergic reactions, and that yes, that means vaccines are unsafe.

people don't just spontaneously wake up one day with an allergy to chicken eggs. 

they have an ""allergic"" immune reaction to chicken egg protein residue in the vaccine.   

>if it did, then that means all medicines, including hoaxes like essential oils are equally dangerous

imagine being so stupid, that this actually sounds like a logical statement.

1) just because Vioxx killed 50,000 people, does not mean COVID vaccine is safe. 

2) could you tell us about your own first-hand experience with ""essential oils""   

>nor does it devalue that person.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_contamination_with_SV40

Vaccine contamination with SV40 occurred in the United States and other countries between 1955 and 1961. Simian vacuolating virus 40, known as SV40, is a virus found in monkeys and humans, which has the potential to cause cancer, in animals and humans. Soon after its discovery, SV40 was identified in early batches of the oral form of the polio vaccine.

maybe you should consider removing your head from your ass?

imagine being so mentally retarded that you continue to look at scientific studies, when you already know that that scientific study has ever found that any vaccine has ever caused a problem. 

i mean, can you even explain where you got the idea that scientific studies were credible sources of information? i hope they didn't teach you that pseudoscientific crap in taxpayer funded public schools.

well, actually, they kind of are. we should be able to identify every component, ingredient, and contaminant in every vaccine.  

>dont let people on facebook posting the chemicals in vaccines scare you,

and don't let your delusions of being well-educated lead you to assume everyone else gets their info from the same sketchy sources that you do. 

>i could post the chemical composition of an apple and say it was the flu vaccine and it would have the same effect.

yes, vaccine quacks are famous for listing all of the ingredients of an apple,

and then somehow extrapolating their not-very-useful illustration into the common-sense vaccine cult 'logic' that if its safe to eat an apple, then it must be safe to inject a vaccine. 

im not sure why this apple example is so popular with vaccine quacks. 

as a very reasonable, and unbiased person myself, i don't find this apples-to-vaccines pro-vaccine argument to be very compelling. 

>vaccines in the most basic terminology are weakened forms of the virus, what scientists do is they weaken the virus so instead of being deadly its virtually harmless, and by injecting it into your own bloodstream your immune system attacks that weakened version of the virus and essentially teaches your immune system how to fight that virus, so say for instance you catch the virus later on, your immune system knows how to fight that virus and can easily neutralize it instead of not knowing how to fight it and possibly dying.

so, this so-called ""immune system"" that you assume that you have, in spite of there being no actual evidence of its existence...

somehow its been able to evolve for billions of years, through millions of generations, 

long before any vaccine quack came along and started snorting smallpox dander...

but now, just a few hundred years after this vaccine quackery is introduced to the world,  

all of the sudden, you *need* 

a flu shot every year (life expectancy is 72? thats 72 flu shots)

50 vaccines before kindergarten

2 doses of COVID vaccine, every year, for the rest of your life...

why would you assume an immune system can learn from the dead germs in your vaccines, 

the same way you can learn to be a boxing champ by punching a bag all day long?

maybe, if your immune system is really that weak, it would be better for ""the herd"" if that specimen died sooner than later. 

vaccines cause virus shedding. 

most of the polio in the world today, is caused by people shitting out live polio virus, after taking live polio vaccine. 

the UN-WHO calls is ""vaccine derived polio"", 

and blames anti-vaxxers for it,

because theoretically, if everyone simply took the live polio vaccine, then it wouldn't matter that more people shit out the live polio virus. 

>the reason people might have a fever

is because vaccines cause fevers. 

and fevers are known to cause things like Dravet Syndrome. 

>or get a lil sick 

notice how the vaccine cult victim/quack will always attempt to minimize, trivialize, or diminish any bad aspect of vaccines 

you got sick, but just a little sick, from his unqualified, 3rd-party observations. 

>after they get a vaccine is simply because your immune system is learning.

1) your immune system has no reason to be ""learning"" about most of the things vaccines are teaching it. 

there should be no big rush to get a measles vaccine in USA , because the chance of catching the measles is pretty low, thanks to vaccines. 

2) you are deliberately causing an immune response, and you assume its safe, simply because you call it a vaccine. 

>now heard immunity,

herd immunity has been naturally occurring for billions of years of evolution. 

vaccine quacks hijacked the concept, and gave vaccines the credit for herd immunity, 

then arbitrarily jacked the herd immunity figure to somewhere above vaccine compliance, 

for the purpose of pushing vaccine mandates, on people who do not want vaccines. 

>immunocompromised people (aka people who have an extremely weak immune system) 

vaccines *cause* immunocompromised people, 

so this idea that we are going to somehow vaccinate our way out of an increasingly immunocompromised population is just more vaccine cult victim's wishful thinking. 

>cannot get vaccines because their bodies cannot handle even the weakened version of the vaccine,

*""vaccine shill template"": some people can't get vaccines, therefore everyone else must*

if it fits the vaccine shill template, then its verified as vaccine propaganda. 

>herd immunity is when everyone else besides the people who are immunocompromised get a vaccine therefor they dont spread the virus to the immunocompromised people and probably kill those people. 

bullshit. immunocompromised people can, and should, be vaccinated first. 

there is no credible evidence that shows immunocompromised people can't benefit from vaccines. 

there is no credible evidence that shows immunocompromised have any valid medical exemptions from vaccines. 

>also the reason for taking the flu vaccine every year is because the flu mutates every year and doctors have to create a new vaccine with a different composition because they dont want the flu to be a pandemic again.

and the flu mutates so quickly, that by the time you get the flu shot, the flu virus has already mutated, making your flu shot obsolete, 

and just another mindless, ritualistic exercise in virtual signaling to the mob of vaccine zombies.

Here's an example you might understand. Your immune system is like a hunter carrying a powerful rifle. However, he's new to hunting, and doesn't know what they look like.

If he encounters a tiger, he'll probably get badly mauled, but now he knows what a tiger looks like and won't get mauled next time. However, getting mauled in this case isn't preferable, since there's a decent chance you might die during the mauling. So, instead, you teach the hunter by showing him the corpse of a dead tiger, showing him that that is bad and should be shot on sight, preventing the hunter from getting mauled again

Well the immune system exists and there is proof just use the internet for actual research instead of going into a facebook group and thinking about new conspiracy theorists.
And actually you made one good point we dont *need* vaccines they just increase your life span and the life span of everyone else.
People before the invention of vaccines died because the immune system either couldnt produce enough antigens or produce them fast enough.
Its like if ur planning on building a house, you first need to make the blueprint which takes a bit of time and then you start building.
So to keep it in that simple house building explanation, the vaccines give your body the weakened or dead virus so the body can figure out a blueprint for the antigens and then start producing them but the difference between that virus you got injected and the virus u would normally get infected with is that the virus u got injected is so weak that it mostly cant cause any harm at all so that your body can produce the antigens without any problem so it kills the weakened virus or gets rid of the dead virus but with the normal virus you get it and it immedeatly starts attacking your body while your immune system still is figuring out how the blueprint should look and then starts producing the antigens and in that time of figuring out the blueprint and building the antigens (the house) the virus freely could cause damage to your body and replicate so that now its much harder to kill off and it also takes longer.
And the reason behind getting the same vaccine every few years (which im surprised the anti vaxx idiots didnt get mad about) is like a restoration. 
So lets say your house got a bit old and isnt that great anymore so you get your old blueprints to make it look the same as before (the vaccine gets injected) and then start fixing the house up again (building new antigens) 



And yeah i hope that explanation for second graders helped u understand how vaccines work so yeah i also am no professional vaccine research guy (however those are called) so if u want to ask something or say something please look at wikipedia first so that you know if ur answer could already be answered by wikipedia or if the thing you were gonna write was just total nonsense.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docking_and_berthing_of_spacecraft

Here just a quick wikipedia entry since i also dont really know that much about it",true_anti_vax
griu8vc,Comment,"A few points:

* L1, L2, and L3 are metastable points that one might argue in a way are like hill crests. L4 and L5 are stable points that are more like valley troughs - also in a way. It's an imperfect analogy.
* #3 makes no sense. The rocket's energy is the sum of its potential and kinetic energy. Orbits are almost always ellipses where both potential and kinetic energy are constantly changing but *their sum is always the same* (hence energy is conserved).
* #4 is wrong. You only need to burn enough fuel to adjust your orbital eccentricity to intersect the Lagrange point (except L4 and L5 where you just need to get close and you will then get pulled into them). Regardless there is no requirement to pass through a Lagrange point on the way to the moon.
* #9 makes no sense. Using ""uphill"" to describe approaching Lagrange points is a problem. You need to specify which Lagrange point and you seem to be talking about L1 - the least stable of the Lagrange points. (The ""sharpest peak"" using your hill crest analogy.)
* #11 is VERY wrong. You have not accounted for the mass of the fuel. At liftoff, the Saturn V has to accelerate not only the CSM+LM, but all of the fuel as well. It might take about 1/6 the fuel supply to return a fully fueled Saturn V from the moon but that isn't what happened.
* #12 is a statement of personal credulity.
* #13 is a straw man. Nobody claims the LM and CSM docked while maintaining a relative speed of 3,500mph.
* #17 doesn't make sense. Energy must be conserved. When the rocket cuts its engines, the sum of its kinetic and potential energies will be constant. If it is slowing down (decreasing kinetic energy) relative to the center of the earth, it must also be moving away (increasing potential energy).
* #19 is a bizarre claim. All you need to do is take an object in stable orbit and burn fuel to increase its velocity for 4 orbits. It doesn't matter how fast *or slow* the fuel is burned. An aircraft cannot do this because its velocity is sub-orbital and it must constantly burn a significant amount of fuel to maintain altitude. If the aircraft tried to get to orbital velocity, friction with the air would melt its aluminum skin. This is why the skin of an airplane like the SR-71 is made of titanium and why manned spacecraft need to have heat shields during atmospheric entry.
* #20 isn't quite complete - there is nowhere in the universe the rocket would be unaffected by the earth and moon. For most of the universe the influence of a single nearby atom of hydrogen would be greater than the earth and moon, but the math doesn't fall to 0 anywhere.
* #21 is a bit of a weasel wording. If the spacecraft exceeds escape velocity it will never ""escape"" the earth's gravity (because of #20) but the pull of earth's gravity will never be enough to pull it back. The only place this doesn't hold is on a body whose gravity is so strong that escape velocity exceeds *c* (the speed of light). The radius above the body's center where this happens is called an ""event horizon"" and the body itself is called a ""black hole"".
* #24 completes the reasoning failure. While there is always a gravitational pull toward the center of the earth, that pull weakens at an exponential rate. By the inverse square law: at the surface of the earth (1 radii from earth's center), the force is 1g; at an altitude of 4,000 miles above the earth's surface (2 radii from earth's center), the force is 1/4g; at an altitude of 8,000 miles (3 radii), the force is 1/9g; and so on. By the time we're at 239,000 miles (~60 radii), the force isn't zero, but it is very weak (1/3540 g). Whatever grandpa's intention, few humans can hike more than 4 miles above the surface of the earth (1.001 radii from earth's center) without succumbing to hypoxia. Humans simply cannot ""walk"" to an altitude where the force of earth's gravity is noticeably different.",true_anti_vax

Everyone I know is at least considerate about wearing masks, just to be considerate to other people, even if they are sceptical about COVID guidelines. A few days ago I was in the supermaket helping out my elderly father who is in an ""at risk"" category with the shopping. By coincidence I had just been vaccinated that day and was wearing a sticker to say so. I'm not the sort of person who'd normally do that but I thought it was a harmless way to help counter the villification of vaccinations. A woman came up next to me, looking a bit sour, glanced at my sticker and looked even sulkier. I gave her a sort of self-deprecating smile to let her know I'm not some kind of evangelist on the subject. She didn't smile back but said ""Could you reach that for me"" pointing to the top shelf, so I said ""Of course"", grabbed the item and handed it to her.

""Thanks""

""No Problem"" I added with another smile. I am tall and get asked this quite a lot.

I hadn't slept properly for a few days so it was only after she'd walked away I remembered I was wearing a mask and she couldn't see my smile then realised I could see her scowl. She wasn't wearing a mask, was smacking her lips whilst eating in the store and had that strangely agressive look on her face. I felt quite angry, she was right next to my dad as well who is particularly vulnerable.

I saw her at the self-checkout and was slowly getting more angry about it. I nearly called out across the shop floor to tell her what I thought but in the end she left before I made up my mind. This has been actually bothering me for a few days. Really a member of staff should have said something before I felt the need to.

It only just ocurred to me, with her angry Karen face and her tensed pantomime swagger that the thing that annoyed her more than anything else was that she was probably looking to provoke an argument and prove some deluded point about her personal entitlement and instead an overly cheerful and polite person didn't even bat an eyelid at her attempts to provoke a reaction from them.

* First dose: zero side effects, less site pain than the flu shot

   * Site pain was **much** worse on this one...like being punched in the arm by a pro boxer (site pain was worst on day 1, less day 2, and minimal by day 3, gone by day 4)
   * Felt fine at noon, went for an 8-mile run
   * Continued to feel fine all day and figured I was out of the woods as most who develop side effects typically present within 8-10 hours
   * 2 AM Sunday woke up with chills and body aches but no fever...took Ibuprofen at 3 AM
   * Couldn't get back to sleep until almost 5 AM and wound up with a 1% WHOOP (biometric tracker) recovery score...i.e. zero recovery or rest.
   * Sunday: spent the entire day between the couch and bed with heavy fatigue and moderate body aches but none of the other symptoms that typically go with this disease (sinus, lung, neurological, etc)
   * In bed by 9 PM Sunday
   * Slept like a rock and woke up at 7 AM Monday and I'm not sure I moved all night (86% recovery)
   * Mild fatigue persisted in the early part of the day but resolved by noon
   * Felt fine by mid-day Monday, 2/8
   * By Tuesday, I was back to 100%

Two weeks out I'm now (according to the data) fully immunized and, other than a strong urge to buy nothing but Microsoft products ( üòâ ) I have absolutely zero side effects.

Any news of an alternative vaccine for those affected by allergies?

gjxk0l0,Comment,"***First of all, I'm not an anti-vaxxer so don't be hostile towards my concerns. I came here looking to be educated. So if you're currently preparing a witty response to my concerns please excuse yourself from this thread.***

My two concerns are:

1. I can't help but feel a little suspicious about the fact that 4 or 5 manufacturers/producers/labs announced the completion of their new vaccine all within a span of a month or so. Given that each product operates using a unique method, I find it a little strange that they all became available at relatively the same time. I'm not necessarily claiming that there must have been some conspiracy or fowl-play involved here, but I would certainly appreciate if anyone could explain the coincidental logistics of how that happened.
2. I'm more than happy to drop point number 1 if these vaccine weren't so rushed. Now I understand that this pandemic ushered in an incredible global effort to develop this vaccine as soon as possible, but I distinctly remember last February when health ministers around the world said that this vaccine would take at least 18-24 months to develop. I hardly ever fall for conspiracies but given what this pandemic has done to the global economies, governments obviously have an immense incentive to push out a vaccine as quickly as possible. And as far as I can tell, there's no way of truly knowing whether or not any steps were skipped during the development of this vaccine.

I live in Dubai, UAE and the Sinopharm (China) and Pfizer-BioNTech (US) vaccines are becoming almost readily available for the general public. Furthermore, many companies are pushing for their employees to take the vaccine (obviously to limit any further paid sick leaves). I'm not completely shutting down the possibility of taking the vaccine but I would definitely like these points addressed before I take it.

Looking forward to your responses!

I just received my second dose of the Pfizer vaccine this afternoon at 3:30pm. I felt fine immediately after, and figured I would have a pretty uneventful experience like I did the first time around (had no side effects except for a sore arm the next day). 

At around 7pm this evening, I started to get a headache that got progressively worse. I laid down for a bit and fell asleep, only to wake up a few hours later with a headache, strong cramps (oddly similar to period cramps) and a low grade fever (99.1 temp). I am wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience so far, or if they had to miss work from side effects of the second dose? I‚Äôm hoping I‚Äôll be able to sleep it off and be back to normal 8 hours from now when I leave for work. 

Other than that, haven‚Äôt grown any extra limbs and my microchip seems to have settled in nicely.",vaxx_happened

gkudged,Comment,"- Pfizer and Moderna both use mRNA technology. Tech that has been in development since 1990. So the groundwork was already laid. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_vaccine#History
- RNA vaccines can be produced much more quickly than vaccines that used killed virus. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_vaccine#Advantages

It is not unusual for companies to have similar research interests or products. Look at a popular drug like Proton Pump Inhibitors and there are half a dozen companies each offering their own version of a PPI. Ditto for lots of other therapies, even cancer therapies.

- Astra Zeneca uses adenoviruses. Adenovirus based vaccines also have decades of research behind them. The Sputnik vaccine also uses adenovirus. 

- The Sputnik site has scores of references to the technology. https://sputnikvaccine.com/about-vaccine/human-adenoviral-vaccines/

So none of these are new except for the payload, that is, the coronavirus spike proteins. And there is nothing coincidental about these companies using similar tech. They are using what is already in the toolbox.

If you have qualms about some companies possibly skipping steps note that large safety trials have been conducted for Pfizer and Moderna and AstraZeneca and it's going into general distribution now, so we'll have even more data points about how it affects people. 

At the end of the day you have to ask yourself what would happen to you when you catch COVID-19 versus what would happen to you if you got the vaccine. And you will catch COVID-19 at some point unless you lock yourself in your house for years. For most of us the vaccine is the safer choice.",vaxx_happened
go3c2n9,Comment,"1. All of the current vaccines are based in methods/designed that have been in development and/or in use for decades, as another user pointed out. This includes the two mRNA vaccines - this is the first widespread use of that technology in humans, but it‚Äôs actually been researched for years. So all of these developers had the basis for the vaccines, and all they needed was the genetic sequence for the right part of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was openly published, so they all had access to it at the same time and began development on these specific vaccines at around the same time. 

2. Yes, the two mRNA vaccines were developed fast, but a large part of that has to do with the method (type) of the vaccine itself. That‚Äôs part of the exciting promise of mRNA vaccines overall - potentially much easier and faster development! And it‚Äôs part of why they were faster than a lot of the estimates - we hadn‚Äôt previously used mRNA vaccines in humans (at least outside a lab setting). So no one knew for sure it would work. And yes, the vaccine approval has been ‚Äúfast tracked‚Äù in some ways, but the details of that depends on each country. Different countries chose different approaches. But an important thing to keep in mind is that the primary goal of those early stage trials in particular is to establish the safety.

The vaccine can fight mutations of covid depending on the kind of mutation. Viruses basically mimic a molecule which a cell‚Äôs receptor bind to normally (like a hormone, for example) in order to gain access to the cell through subterfuge. They mimic this molecule with their spikes located on their outer protein coat. The spikes themselves are the mimic. If the virus can‚Äôt use the spike, it cannot gain access to our cells and harm us. If the mutation occurred in the spike of a virus, and the spike changed significantly because of this mutation, the vaccine would be absolutely useless against this hypothetical variant of covid.

giq571p,Comment,"It uses mRNA to get your cells to make the covid proteins to teach your immune system what they look like. It doesn't modify your DNA though, it just induces cells to make certain proteins until they run out of mRNA. 

Like if the genome of DNA in a cell was a cookbook on how to make specific dishes, mRNA is a copy of one of the recipes that the cook uses to make specific dishes. The cook never works directly off the cookbook itself, they just copy out the recipe they need right then and work off of that until the copy degrades and can't be used anymore. What the vaccine is doing is taking a copy of a page from a different cookbook and subbing it in so the cook will make a specific order of that dish instead. The human cookbook isn't altered in any way, the chef just keeps making the dish until the copy degrades into uselessness. (Let me know if that makes sense)

> Sorry to say it but I was gona get the vaccine but now that its not gona protect me from the virus at all still have wear mask all that crap what's point in getting this experimental vaccine if it dosent protect me or anyone else like 

Nothing you said here is true, literally nothing. 

1. The vaccine is not experimental, they have gone through extremely extensive clinical trials. Not only that, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have millions of doses dispensed at this point. Combined with the government monitoring going on, these vaccines have had an extremely high level of validation. Nothing about these vaccines is experimental anymore. 
2. The Pfizer, Moderna, and Oxford vaccines have all shown significant protection from the virus. Preliminary studies are showing efficacies of *up to* 90% against infection and spread for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. Other studies are also showing far more than sufficient efficacy against all currently known variants of the virus. 
3. You won't have to wear a mask forever and literally nobody is talking about it forever. 

>I'm not anti at all but...

Said every antivaxer before they proceed to say something clearly antivax. 

>now I have looked into it an all the people who have had bad reaction to it and not to mention all the deaths that they are trying to say was there underlying conditions I dont belive it.

And here it is.  The adverse reaction rates are  low overall with almost all being a result of the strong immune response to the vaccine. Most of the side effects are minor like soreness, slight fever, aches, etc. The severe stuff gets the headlines but the rates are something closer to single digits per million vaccinated.

As for deaths, anyone with a brain knows the number of doses we have dispensed at this point GUARANTEES that people will die of other causes within hours of receiving the vaccine. You could take an equal number of people unvaccinated and you would get a similar rate of random symptoms and deaths. You don't need to believe it, it is sheer statistics. 

If there was any truth to the matter, there would be massive scientific opposition. Yet, outside of some antivax crazies who would whine about it no matter what, not a peep. 

>To manny notable doctors speaking out against it. I rather fight it with natural immunity. 

Who? Literally NO reputable doctors are speaking out against these vaccines. The ONLY ones speaking out are naturopathic/antivax doctors.

If a private business wants to require customers or employees to wear masks, they likely can, even under the ADA, as long as they can provide a reasonable alternative, such as delivery / pickup, or telecommuting.  again, IANAL, so just my thoughts.

go3asoe,Comment,"1. Yes, it‚Äôs possible you could still get COVID even after being vaccinated for a variety of reasons.

gsa2tzx,Comment,"Hi, not harsh at all. I am glad you answered.
I postponed my appointment so this vaccine will be passed on to someone else that wants it. I agree that it is irrational not to take it and there is probably no need to be so cautious I decided it is for the best to postpone it a bit and calm down as the anxiety was too much and I was not being able to function properly.
 I am a bit worried regarding the age groups that the vaccine has been given to. As far as I know it has been given to mostly older people for example in britain, maybe I am mistaking as I was not able to find reliable info for this on the internet. But as far as I know those countries have priority groups to vaccinate first. And regarding the rare blood clots combined with low platelets count from what I gather it is mostly in younger population between 19-55 years old. So could it be that it's a severe side effect that as time goes on will be revealed to affect more and more young people? That is if the theories from I think it was norway and germany are true that these events of CSVT were connected to the vaccine. 
Another thing is I recently had a blood test and it showed slightly lower platelets count according to the reference sheet from the laboratory. My doctor didn't seem to make much of it at the time and said I should be ok to go ahead with a vaccine, that was before the blood clot reports however. So could this have a negative effect?
I am worried that it will turn up that I have some condition or disease that will make me have a bad reaction to the vaccine. ( Which I guess is pretty hypochondriac)",vaxx_happened
gisod0d,Comment,"Anaphylactic reactions are rare, and usually happen within the first few minutes. Hence why they get you to wait 15-30 minutes after! There should be people there to watch you after, and just let the healthcare provider know that you get anxious before/after so they can keep a closer eye on you. We‚Äôre trained to watch for the signs of anaphylaxis, and how to initiate treatment in case it does happen. 

Allie (the NP student that was with me) reassured me that despite the chest tightness and increased heart rate, I didn‚Äôt have itchy hives or facial swelling. Grounding exercises, reassurance, and deep breathing helped the anxiety pass after about 10-15 minutes. I‚Äôd only ever had one bout of anxiety like that before, and that was during an invasive dental procedure. 

Hope you get the chance to get yours soon, and let me know how it goes :)",vaxx_happened

glglv48,Comment,"Short answer: The ADA requires reasonable accommodation but that doesn't apply if it risks the health and safety of others. Thus, masks protecting the health and safety of the employees and other patrons are totally legal, especially when other forms of service are provided such as online shopping and delivery.

Regarding state actors: I highly doubt that due to the fact that a business which does not allow laws to be broken on their premises is not currently considered a state actor so I can't imagine that would change for this situation exclusively. Not shoes, no shirt, no mask: no service.

A disability which precludes the wearing of masks would place the individual into a protected class, but that doesn't mean a business has to allow them to enter maskless during a pandemic due to aforementioned safety concerns. They would have to be denied service based on their belonging to that class rather than the physical act of not wearing a mask. Only simile I can come up with is that it is illegal to deny service to a gay couple because they are gay, but you could kick them out/deny service if they were having sex in your store. The being gay is protected, but an action which results from being gay, if it endangers others' health (sex of any nature is unsanitary in a bakery), is not protected.",vaxx_happened

gsa3r9u,Comment,"> So could it be that it's a severe side effect that as time goes on will be revealed to affect more and more young people?

I am German, and I can assure, that the vaccine didn't actually have any correlation 

Here's a little comparison:

[Birth Control Pills:](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/combination-birth-control-pills/about/pac-20385282) Chances of blood clots: 1100: 1.000.000

AZ Vaccine: Chances of blood clots: 50: 17.000.000

If the vaccine had any high correlation, then there would have been thousands of deaths.

Besides, our politicians became pretty much limpdicks by now, so I heavily abhorred their decision to halt the vaccinations for 3 days.

The only side effects I had (19 y/o) were limb pain and a feeling, similar to a hangover after you drank 5 Oktoberfest mugs of beer the last evening. These symptoms are rather on the heavy side, but they sublimated after 6 to 7 hours

And that was my fault for running into a store and grabbing an RTX 2080 Super Graphics Card, so don't go overkill on the action the next day.

&#x200B;

And if anxiety is the problem, I hate needles as well, and since the doctors vaccinating there are well-trained, you don't actually have anything to fear.

They still put you on 20 min watch, so they can make sure, that you don't pass out, which I skipped, since I needed to get back to work.

Also awful. 
The work they put into spreading it, at a time when life was cheap and travel was slow tells of the importance of vaccines and the danger of smallpox.

Vaccine actually comes from vacca for cow. Because cow pox is a less deadly form of smallpox. 

They literally lanced cow pox pustules and scratched the puss into other people to vaccinate them. To bring it further, town to town they'd rub puss into a cloth and bring that but it couldn't cross oceans because it would dry up.

So they took a bunch of little orphan boys and infected 2 of them... then spread it to others during the voyage. The story goes that the last boy had just one pustule left when they got to shore in the Americas.

Vaccination spread to the rest of the world insanely fast after that (for the time).

Woke up to one of my kids choking silently on his back on his own spit up in his crib four feet from where I was in bed. He never turned his head, tried to roll, or struggle. He would have laid there and died had something not made me wake up to check on him. My baby was turning blue, just staring up at the ceiling, not even thrashing his arms. Co slept after that and would never try the crib again, it was traumatizing. The fact that I did everything right with his crib was the scariest part.

Wound up co sleeping with all of my kids safely. I'm not sure why so many people are commenting that it's dangerous. It's really Western and Europeans countries that think that, the basis being death by unsafe practice.",vaxx_happened
gsbbl9y,Comment,"Yes! My siblings and I all coslept with our parents and my daughter coslept with me, but the reason we were all okay is that 1. It was never done under the influence of any substance and 2. It was done carefully.

My daughter was always held out to the side with no blankets over her upper body and my head set apart from hers enough that we each had a ""bubble"" or space with which to breathe without interference. I spelt with one arm outside the blankets for over a year because I cradled her in that space to keep her still and safe. I have also never been one to roll around while asleep.

Even if the chances of anything negative happening are 10 per million (or 0.001%, that sounds better), accepting the possibility that *they* initiated it is way worse to them than accepting 'fate' and doing nothing, even if that fate is much more likely to have a negative outcome.

Smoked from 15 years old, heavily through college(pack a day) and just recently kicked nicotine for good at 38.

Failed with alot of the same methods and everyone will be different.

At 34, my new girlfriend hated my smoking habit, so she did her research and purchased me a pretty nice vape setup.  I started at a 6mg, and it took about 6 weeks to fully transition over.  Within a year I couldn't stand the taste of a cigarette by comparison.  

(Pro tip, absolutely stay away from nicotine associated flavors, find fruits, sours, etc, you need to disssociate the taste)

I kept vaping for the next 4-5 years.  At some point I tapered down to a 3mg(within the last couple months), which for a time increased my juice consumption but leveled off quickly

Recently I started having some health issues, one was minor intermittent breathing difficulty.  (Pre pandemic I was back up to running 3 miles a day easily without breathing issues)

Ultimately we don't think my issue is vape related, but it was triggering/excacerbating another ongoing condition in my body at times.

I bought 2mg nicotine gum and started using that instead when I felt a craving.  Nicotine gum is gross.  It leaves a weird feeling/taste in your throat.  I didn't like it.

After about a week, I realized I wasn't feeling that ""blood on fire"" craving but was really needing the action more than anything.  

So I tried subbing with plain old lollipops.  I have not felt a nic craving since.(I absolutely know the difference)  My lollipop budget is starting to normalize.

The point here is I was absolutely blown away at how quickly my body was able to delineate between the craving for the drug and the craving for the action.

Nicotine withdrawal is real, but so is habit withdrawal, everyone's balance is different.  I just couldn't believe how quickly my body was totally fine without the drug(less than a week) as long as I could scratch my habit itch.",vaxx_happened

gs7ptz7,Comment,"Yeah. He gave a TED talk where the title was ""Vaccines can reduce the global population"". While Bill Gates has good intentions, he couldnt have possibly came up with a worse title for click bait conspiracy theorists to take out of context if he tried. Without context it sounds like he's poisoning the vaccines. The TED talk is now almost impossible to find because they took it down due to all the conspiracies, which I think makes it worse because now it looks like he's hiding something and you cant provide a link to the original context now.

Anyway, the point was people in poor contries have high child mortality rates so they have lots of kids so that some will actually make it to adult hood. In the west people have 2 or 3 kids, and not 10 like in 3rd world contries. Having 10 kids makes it hard to give each a quality upbringing. One way to combat poverty is to reduce the need for a huge family so you can produce more educated kids. You can do that by vaccinating everyone so that child mortality rates decrease.

You may not know you have underlying conditions. 

What qualifies as underlying conditions? To name a few, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, smoking habit, cancer, heart disease, kidney disease.

I would venture a guess that maybe more than half of american adults have one of these, with a significant cohort having more than one. Hell, I'm 28, active, fully employed, and have three conditions that dramatically increase my risk.

I was already mentally ready to be done with my shift that day and my response was slightly unprofessional. ""Sorry, I was trying to keep someone alive after their heart stopped,"" I said.

But the weirdest thing about me is my problem with processing information. It‚Äôs hard for me to keep up with conversations or follow what someone is saying or do math. My tutor reported to my mom that I was ‚Äúextremely good with the mathematical process, she,‚Äù‚Äîthat‚Äôs me‚Äî‚Äújust needs help with theory and understanding how to get started on an equation.‚Äù Essentially: I‚Äôm actually okay with math; I understand the ‚Äúhow‚Äù of it, but I don‚Äôt get the ‚Äúwhy do I start here?‚Äù bit.

Anyway, math aside, I don‚Äôt really know much about it. Hell, I don‚Äôt even know whether I was born with the seizures or if I developed it later on or if it‚Äôs from a bad fall or what. I‚Äôm somewhat of a scientific anomaly, to use the epilepsy specialist‚Äôs words.

So silent you‚Äôd swear I was deaf. And just as suddenly, sound returns, but irl sounds this time, like knocking on the door, shouts of ‚Äúyou okay? Answer me!‚Äù, a faucet left running, the sounds that I make as I choke on my own saliva or blood or vomit or all at once. I‚Äôm kinda dazed during my hallucinating‚Äîlike in the back of my mind I can vaguely register ‚Äúoh look at that I‚Äôm in the bathroom‚Äù but the clearest thing is whatever sensory fuckery is going on that time. The general full-body soreness is at the back of my mind as well so I‚Äôm *aware* of it but it only registers as ‚Äúpain pain ow pain ow‚Äù when the seizure is done.

grgdnqn,Comment,"I mean, it actually kinda is - it's both a kind of (extremely short term) gene therapy and a vaccine. The vaccine is, in short, an adenovirus reprogrammed to insert DNA/mRNA (depending on specific vaccine - the mRNA is why Pfizer has to be kept cold iirc) that produces the spike protein, it inserts it into a spot in your DNA where nothing useful is located. So your cells produce spike protein, and you get an immune response. It doesn't last long - a benefit of adenoviruses. The fact of how short term it is (weeks) is why they're not using it as a normal gene therapy. 

Note I don't have a problem with this method. It works pretty well imo. 

This is actually a promising way to do stuff like cure lactose intolerance, but using an adeno-associated virus. The Thought Emporium on YouTube did this to cure his lactose intolerance by growing a virus to insert a lactase producing gene into his gut cells. That's what put me onto researching this.

Also, most of the things stopping gene therapy are the fact it's much harder to knock out and replace a section of DNA than it is to add DNA (which is what the mRNA vaccines do). Lentiviruses are very well studied and a safe packaging option (as well as being able to insert DNA permanently, allowing lifetime changes) but people hear ""HIV"" and are rightly concerned. The lentiviral packagings used these days have 4 different required parts the cells lack to reproduce, so they can't actually produce HIV. And the fact they've got your gene target instead of their stuff.",vaxx_happened

grmlcbj,Comment,"To be fair, currently available covid-19 vaccines aren't actually able to prevent infection, due to inducing the production of IgG antibodies that reside in the blood rather than IgA antibodies that reside in mucous membranes. It's likely to reduce transmission since any infection would be dealt with rather quickly due to the innate immunity that memory B cells and the produced IgGs would provide, but viral particles that remain in the respiratory tract and didn't trigger any immune response yet would still be able to be blown out and infect other people. 

Obviously it gets much worse as it goes on tho, with that gene therapy line giving me a good chuckle.

gret89x,Comment,"I mean I can kinda see where the misunderstanding stems from here, as the pfizer and Moderna vaccines use mRNA coding for parts of the spike protein rather than parts from the virus. While you probably already know all this including that mRNA and RNA don't work the same way, many viruses (including coronaviruses) use RNA to infect cells where it gets converted into DNA before it starts producing more copies of the virus. Sometimes this DNA ends up incorporating itself into the genome of the host cell and persists through generations of the host cell dividing. 

So if someone had cursory knowledge of these things and equated mRNA to RNA, I can totally see how they could come to this conclusion.

In the 1950s between 10-30% of the polio accines were contaminated with simian virus

In the 1970s there were vaccines for the swine flu that ended up giving some vaccinated  Guillian Barre syndrome which is a neurological disorder. 


We are lucky in that most of the vaccines we take have been tested for a long period of time  not months.  We don't even know how long the immunization lasts for because the studies are too new. 

Everyone should decide what they want to do.  I wont be getting the vaccine right now. Its to new for me to do so.

So for example my life insurance wouldn't cover suicide or death from self-inflicted injury within the first year of taking out the policy, or death from terminal illness which is untreatable AND has a prognosis of **more** than 12 months. Unless the underwriters tried to claim taking the vaccine is literal suicide (spoiler: they won't) then dying within the first year wouldn't trigger either exception and they'd be required to honour the claim.

Barring fraud or the suicide moral hazard explicitly called out in the policy terms, there‚Äôs really no mechanism or reason for life insurance policies to try to avoid paying out. It‚Äôs cheaper to honor the terms than to defend anything sketchy in court.

9 times out of 10 they make a claim like ""I wouldn't ever let this in my body!""  Not just inject, but let it in their body in any way.  They also routinely make claims like ""If I fed my child {list of scary chemicals in vaccines} I would be arrested for child abuse.""  So let's not pretend they understand the difference between ingesting and injecting.  Someone will almost always point out if you injected broccoli in to your child with a needle you would also be arrested.

My point is that to them, any {scary sounding chemical} is bad in any circumstance, but they don't understand that many of them are perfectly safe in small doses.  Eat a couple pieces of black licorice and you are fine.

About 18 hours after the shot (at around 3am), I got a *splitting* headache, like felt like my head was cleaved in two. This is also when I noticed just how much my arm fucking **hurt**. Not just sore, really legitimately HURT. For context, I broke my leg about 3 weeks before this shot and my arm hurt noticeably worse than my leg at that point. I had been off narcotics for the leg for more then a week at that point, but I was in enough pain, both from my arm and my head, that I took a dose of the pills I had left from the broken leg. About 24 hours post shot I started to get chills and was running a fever of 101. I was hurting and exhausted allllll day. But by 48 hours later it was over and I was feeling back to normal again. Not gonna lie, it was an unpleasant day.

lace91,"Sobre las vacunas para el COVID19, compilaci√≥n de textos cient√≠ficos y opini√≥n personal.","A prop√≥sito de los comentarios que he le√≠do y escuchado sobre las vacunas para el COVID19, pero sobre todo de la vacuna rusa Sputnik V, me he dado a la tarea de estudiar algunos textos cient√≠ficos y hacer una compilaci√≥n de los mismos para hacerlos de su conocimiento, a continuaci√≥n les comparto

**SOBRE LA VACUNA RUSA SPUTNIK V**  
The Lancet, una de las revistas m√©dicas m√°s prestigiosas del mundo, public√≥ los resultados de los ensayos de la primera y la segunda fase de la vacuna rusa SPUTNIK V, que demostraron lo siguiente:

1. La plataforma de vectores adenovirales humanos es eficaz, a pesar de las preocupaciones por la posibilidad de una inmunidad preexistente a los adenovirus.

2. Se seleccion√≥ la dosis segura √≥ptima que permiti√≥ lograr una respuesta inmunitaria humoral y celular en el 100 % de los participantes, incluso en aquellos que hab√≠an tenido una infecci√≥n con adenovirus.

3. El uso de dos vectores diferentes permite lograr una respuesta inmune m√°s efectiva.

4. El nivel de anticuerpos contra el SARS-CoV-2 en voluntarios vacunados con Sputnik V fue entre 1,4 y 1,5 veces m√°s alto que el nivel de anticuerpos en los pacientes que se hab√≠an recuperado del covid-19.

5. Tiene una eficacia de 91.4 por ciento contra el virus SARS-CoV-2, y de 100 por ciento para evitar los cuadros graves de la enfermedad Covid-19.

Al mismo tiempo, no se encontraron eventos adversos graves en los vacunados con Sputnik V, mientras que para otras vacunas, este par√°metro oscila entre el 1 y el 25 por ciento.

Varias otras empresas est√°n utilizando tambi√©n plataformas basadas en vectores adenovirales humanos para sus vacunas contra el covid-19, como por ejemplo Johnson & Johnson, que usa el vector Ad26, y la china CanSino, que emplea el Ad5 mientras que la Rusa SPUTNIK V utiliza dos vectores adenovirales, el Ad5 y el Ad26.

Vale la pena mencionar que las plataformas para vacunas que usan otros pa√≠ses, como el vector de adenovirus de chimpanc√© (OXFORD-ASTRA ZENECA, quienes por cierto est√°n estudiando la posibilidad de aplicar de manera conjunta su vacuna y la SPUTNIK V para incrementar su efectividad) o la tecnolog√≠a de ARN (PFIZER-BIONTECH), nunca antes hab√≠an sido utilizadas en vacunas que hayan pasado la FASE 3. Tampoco han sido sometidas a estudios a largo plazo sobre sus posibles efectos secundarios en el cuerpo humano, como por ejemplo los riesgos de desarrollar complicaciones relacionadas con el c√°ncer o sus efectos sobre la fertilidad.

**Las vacunas de ARN mensajero (PFIZER-BIONTECH-MODERNA).**  
La mayor preocupaci√≥n con este tipo de vacunas ha sido su inestabilidad, su baja eficiencia para introducirlas en las c√©lulas y que expresen el ant√≠geno. Tambi√©n ha preocupado el hecho de que el ARN puede estimular reacciones inmunol√≥gicas de tipo inflamatorio, por lo que todos estos factores han limitado en parte su desarrollo. El ARN es una mol√©cula muy inestable que requiere condiciones de mantenimiento extremas (de menos 80‚ÑÉ), se degrada muy f√°cilmente por enzimas y no se internaliza de forma eficiente.

Sin embargo, esta tecnolog√≠a tambi√©n tiene ventajas. Es relativamente m√°s barata que otro tipo de vacunas y, sobre todo, permite dise√±ar una vacuna nueva en un tiempo r√©cord. Una vez que se conoce el genoma del pat√≥geno, en unas semanas se pueden producir los primeros prototipos vacunales, lo que la convierte en una excelente herramienta cuando aparece un pat√≥geno nuevo para el que se necesita una vacuna con urgencia, como en una pandemia. En este caso, la rapidez es un beneficio mayor que el problema de su inestabilidad. Moderna fue capaz de dise√±ar su vacuna de ARNm contra SARS-CoV-2 tan solo seis semanas despu√©s de que el genoma del virus se hiciera p√∫blico.

**MI OPINI√ìN.**  
Por un lado la vacuna rusa aprovecha los modelos de vacunas ya probados, innova en el sentido de usar dos vectores en lugar de uno solo. Es un modelo que, si bien no tiene la efectividad que manifiestan en las vacunas de ARN mensajero, es m√°s segura en t√©rminos de efectos secundarios adversos e igual de efectiva que la vacunas que todos conocemos hasta ahora y que nos hemos aplicado.

Por el otro lado Pfizer y otras le apuestan al futuro y a lo econ√≥mico, puede que en esta ocasi√≥n tengan tropezones pero el avance que van a lograr es un ahorro en a√±os de investigaci√≥n, a√∫n as√≠, como el resto de las vacunas, el reto ser√° que en el mediano y largo plazo resulten eficaces y que sus efectos adversos sean m√≠nimos para poder compararlas con el modelo tradicional de vacunas que, guste o no a pol√≠ticos y villamelones, es eficaz y seguro.

**¬øCONCLUSI√ìN?**  
Me encuentro optimista, las vacunas contra el COVID19 comentadas en este texto han demostrado cient√≠ficamente que podemos seguir confiando en la ciencia para resolver y prevenir problemas de salud como las pandemias. La competencia entre cient√≠ficos es sana y provoca desarrollos alternativos, lo que nos permite tener varias respuestas a un mismo problema y con ello se abran posibilidades para tomar decisiones que, de acuerdo a cada pa√≠s, pueden ser m√°s adecuadas para cada uno.   

¬øGuerra fr√≠a en pleno siglo XXI?

kwt886,"*SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN*, verified and established FACTS to immediately shut down the arguments of an uneducated anti-vaxxer. This post contains facts that will help you win any vaccine debate.","This comprehensive and thorough list of facts will help you to counter and win any vaccine debate. If an antivaxer is attacking you or making baseless/outlandish + unscientific claims, you can use this list of information to shut their arguments down immediately with facts:

\-**Vaccines are extremely safe**: in fact, *no serious adverse events* (besides injection site pain/erythema) have ever actually been proven.

\-Vaccine adverse events are notoriously **OVER** (not under!) reported. It is estimated by a Harvard study using data mining technology + VAERS reports that **adverse events are reported at 100x** (or more) the **rate that they actually occur.**

\-One study found that **97% of ""adverse events""** from vaccines are actually **nocebo effects** (like the placebo effect, people believe/imagine they are having symptoms due to fear/expectation)

\-Not **a single case of autism** has ever made it to higher courts, because the **autism + vaccine connection has an overwhelming amount of research debunking it.**

\-in 1986, vaccine manufacturers took **on increased liability** for their product to reassure the public of safety: this is because research has proven without doubt that vaccines are **incredibly safe.** Despite manufacture liability, vaccine manufactures have never actually needed to pay out any amount for any purported ""injury"" claims. The evidence is overwhelming to **debunk these claims.**

\-**Andrew Wakefield,** a public disgrace and conspiracist theorist with multiple agendas, is the **only physician or scientist** to have **ever published a medical paper criticizing vaccine safety**. His paper was later **retracted for fraud** and his licence **revoked**.

\-**Vaccine inserts** list events that occur normally in populations and **do NOT prove any causative association** between vaccines and these purported ""events"". If the events listed in vaccine inserts actually \*caused\* these effects, billions in personal injury lawsuits would be paid out --> which is *not* the case!

\-Unlike what antivaxers claim, it has been proven thoroughly that Gardasil is incredibly safe. The supposed ""injuries"" that circulate the internet in the form of horror stories can be explained psychologically by the phenomenon of mass psychogenic events, instigated by fear + the nocebo effect.

\-The MMR does not cause any adverse neurological events or damage in the brains of laboratory animals, even at doses higher than used in humans.

\-The cumulative effect of the entire vaccination schedule (72 doses in children by the age of 18 today, in 2020) has been completely and thoroughly investigated for safety, and no issues have been found.

\-Vaccines have rigorous long-term safety studies for all potential of carcinogenicity, fertility, and long-term health adverse effects, and no issues have been found.

\-Despite some ethical concerns raised, several vaccinated vs. unvaccinated studies have been conducted. It was found that vaccinated children have significantly lower rates of allergies, chronic health problems, and neurological issues.

\-Vaccines are thought to have a potential neuroprotective and anti-cancer effect, which is still being studied. It is suspected that vaccines may prevent infertility, dementia, and cancer, although further investigation is needed.

\-All clinical trials for vaccines use double-blinded trials with saline placebos, which is the gold standard in medical research.

\-The FDA has an independent taxpayer-funded committee to examine and analyze all raw data from vaccine clinical trials. Scientists and data analysts conducting this research have extensive background testing to ensure no conflicts of interest in any pharmaceutical company. This debunks the myth of ""conflict of interest"" regarding vaccine manufacturers funding their own safety studies for FDA/CDC approval.

\-There are comprehensive laws to prevent the myth of the ‚Äúrevolving door‚Äù phenomenon that anti-vaxers like to use as proof of government-pharmaceutical corruption. If a scientist/researcher who investigated vaccine safety has had any financial ties to a pharmaceutical company, they are disqualified from the vaccine approval committee. Similarly, once an individual has worked in the field of vaccine approval for the FDA/CDC, they are unable to accept positions as pharmaceutical-hired scientists. These laws prevent conflicts of interest between vaccine approval and pharmaceutical profit.

\-Studies of vaccinated vs unvaccinated infants have thoroughly refuted any claims linking vaccines to SIDS.

\-The USA has very high vaccination rates as well as one of the lowest rates of infant mortality in all developed nations.

\-France, which has a notoriously high rate of vaccine hesitancy, has higher rates of autism, SIDS, and chronic illnesses than other developed countries of similar socioeconomic structure.

\-Autism is ‚Äúmore prevalent‚Äù due to more advanced and specific diagnostic criteria. Once diagnostic criteria was established, people of older generations (age 50‚Äôs-80‚Äôs) were found to have nearly identical rates of autism to those of younger generations (age 40‚Äôs and under).

IgM shows an acute infection, but in Sars Cov 2, they fade away slower. But the IgG shows the protective antibody number. Depending on the laboratory's ranges, you'll see if you have a high enough number to be protected. 

If the patient is protected, they don't need a new vaccine too soon.",vaccine_myth

A study published in 1998 - since discredited and withdrawn - associated the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine with autism. But the concern it sparked among parents lives on.

‚ÄúPeople didn't like that they were about to be injected with a biological product they didn't understand, and that was the birth of anti-vaccine movements,‚Äù Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia, told ABC.

Experts say, there‚Äôs work to be done to ensure that happens. As distribution of the first 2.9 million doses kicks into gear, public health experts prepare to parse fact from fiction.

The argument that there is a genetic component to autism is not by itself a proof that vaccines cause autism.

 Argument X:  ""It is also often argued that unvaccinated autistic people prove autism is not caused by vaccines""

I often argue the fact the people unvaccinated for MMR  get autism at  about the same rate as people vaccinated for MMR is good evidence that the MMR vaccine does not cause autism.  The argument X above appears to be a misrepresentation of that argument by less intelligent people on reddit.

When vaccines are introduced, tests are done to see if they are safe.  They don't test for every single disease in the book.  In general, tests were not done for autism specifically in the distant past.

 Andrew Wakefield wrote a research article claiming the MMR might be associated with autism.  The article was analyzed and Wakefield was discredited and eventually lost his license.

At this point there was no reason to do further analysis scientifically on the subject.  There was no reason to think that the MMR vaccine caused autism.  Safety research on vaccines does not do analysis on every disease in the book.

However, with many vaccine opponents spreading false claims that MMR vaccine cause autism,  a large expensive research project was performed to show that MMR vaccine is not linked to autism.

  
There have not been large expensive research projects to prove every single vaccine does not cause autism.  There are also a thousand + other diseases we could study if there was money enough.  Similarly, tests could be done to see what correlations there are between every drug and food we take with every disease, but there is just not enough money for this.",vaccine_myth

&#x200B;

Why are the world‚Äôs top vaccine promoters, like Paul Offit and Peter Hotez, frantically warning us about the unique and frightening dangers inherent in developing a coronavirus vaccine?

Scientists first attempted to [develop coronavirus vaccines](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22536382) after China‚Äôs 2002 SARS-CoV outbreak. Teams of US & foreign scientists vaccinated animals with the four most promising vaccines. At first, the experiment seemed successful as all the animals developed a robust antibody response to coronavirus. However, when the scientists exposed the vaccinated animals to the wild virus, the results were horrifying. Vaccinated animals [suffered hyper-immune responses](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22536382) including inflammation throughout their bodies, especially in their lungs. Researchers had seen this same ‚Äúenhanced immune response‚Äù during human testing of the [failed RSV vaccine tests](https://cvi.asm.org/content/23/3/189) in the 1960s. [Two children died](https://cvi.asm.org/content/23/3/189).

In this video footage, Offit, Hotez and even Anthony Fauci (in an unguarded moment), warn that any new coronavirus vaccine could trigger lethal immune reactions ‚Äúvaccine enhancement‚Äù when vaccinated people come in contact with the wild virus. Instead of proceeding with caution, Fauci has made the reckless choice to [fast track](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200316005666/en/Moderna-Announces-Participant-Dosed-NIH-led-Phase-1) vaccines, partially [funded by Gates](https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/bill-gates-says-foundation-will-invest-billions-fight-stop-covid-19/MMAFTSVGKZHPTEGYKEQKMRWTWU/), without critical [animal studies](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/11/researchers-rush-to-start-moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-without-usual-animal-testing/) before moving into human clinical trials that could provide early warning of runaway immune response.

Gates (in the video) is so worried about the danger of adverse events that he says vaccines shouldn‚Äôt be distributed until governments [agree to indemnity](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2020/04/09/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-microsoft-co-founder-bill-gates-on-past-pandemic-warnings.html?__source=iosappshare%7Ccom.apple.UIKit.activity.Mail&fbclid=IwAR0RG79OtbdXUpY_ylULT6sY_Xo5D-cBQ0awSo6vGS19VnLGqB9z)against lawsuits. On February 4,¬†2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html), there were only [11 active CV cases](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html) in the USA, yet the U.S. quietly pushed through [Federal regulations](https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/prepact/Pages/COVID19.aspx) giving coronavirus vaccine makers full immunity from liability.

There are a lot of incentives to jump through hoops with any vaccine that ""works"" well enough in studies and is feasible to produce.

This also includes political willingness to say ""this is good enough, spread it"". 

So proper vaccine scientists warn that the temptation to approve **any** vaccine will probably be an issue.
Also, there are many new technologies being used for this vaccine, some of them never before used for vaccine development in humans.
There are a lot of unknowns, so experts are saying ""let the science be done, don't rush it""

As you may know, vaccination is essential because it helps provide immunity before an individual is exposed to certain life-threatening diseases such as chickenpox or measles. There is a possibility that your child might get measles for an example, but very unlikely. According to the Mayo Clinic, more than 93% of people who get the first dose of MMR develop immunity to measles. After the second dose, about 97% of people are protected. The 2020 Recommended immunizations for children from birth through 6-years old from CDC are linked [here](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/parents/downloads/parent-ver-sch-0-6yrs.pdf). According to the CDC, ‚Äúeveryone six months and older should get the influenza (flu) vaccine every season.

Nope. That's not true. Healthy carriers can exist, but not for preventable diseases through vaccination. They can exist for staph aureus, for some strep spp. for example. But not the diseases someone is vaccinated against. There are literally no asymptomatic carriers, like there are in COVID-19.

>Warfel et al. point out that asymptomatic infection in aP vaccinated individuals, and subsequent transmission, may partially account for the increase in observed *B. pertussis* incidence. However, from a public health perspective, the presence of vaccine-induced or naturally infected asymptomatic individuals who transmit disease could have consequences beyond facilitating an increase in incidence. In response to Warfel et al., Domenech de Cell√®s et al. (2014) \[[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482312/#CR15)\] argue that a reduction in incidence among unvaccinated individuals in a population with high aP coverage shows that aP must reduce *B. pertussis* transmission to some extent. It may be that aP vaccinated infected people are less efficient at transmitting *B. pertussis* compared with unvaccinated infected people, though it is not clear to what extent \[[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4482312/#CR16)\].

>Here, we examine incidence and genetic data to provide empirical support for asymptomatic transmission and then construct mathematical models of *B. pertussis* transmission to explore the public health consequences of asymptomatic transmission. Our results suggest that: 1) there is strong empirical support for asymptomatic transmission from both the epidemiological and genomic data; 2) the presence of asymptomatic transmitters will bias estimates of vaccine efficacy derived from observations of stochastic fadeouts across cities; and 3) asymptomatic transmission provides the most parsimonious explanation for many of the observed patterns associated with current *B. pertussis* dynamics in the US and UK (that is, the resurgence of cases, the changes in age-specific attack rates, the observed level of bacterial genetic variation, and the failure of ring-vaccinating, or ‚Äúcocooning‚Äù, unvaccinated infants).

You missed this paragraph I guess, that the data is not showing a clear causation. 

> ""A second issue is that clearly not enough time has elapsed since the switch to aP to draw definitive conclusions about the resumption of cycles of B. pertussis incidence. While the data appear most consistent with asymptomatic transmission from aP vaccinated individuals, it may be many years before enough time has elapsed to be able to rule out this hypothesis.""


Also other disclaimers:

>Our model does not explicitly account for evolution of the B. pertussis bacterium [7, 56] ‚Äî a factor which may play a large role in the epidemiological dynamics of B. pertussis. For example, it has been posited that B. pertussis has adapted to vaccination in several European countries. Mooi et al. (2001) identified genetic changes between pre- and post-vaccination strains of B. pertussis [8]. Despite this evidence, including evolution would merely increase the number of individuals susceptible to both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection and would yield exactly the opposite pattern of population genomic variation than seen empirically.



________________________________________________________________
The aP vaccine (acellular pertussis) is reliable for kids especially, somewhat similar to the rotaviral vaccine and maybe the meningococcal one too, because it offers immunity for a few  critical years, when kids are small and vulnerable. Unlike the whole cell pertussis vaccine, which gives a longer and sturdier immunity.

Nobody expects these vaccines to be efficient and create immunity per life. The same with tetanus and diphtheria. You have to get boosters to be actually protected for longer periods of time! Otherwise your antibody count will become super low and you become susceptible to the infection AND maybe becoming a carrier. Sure, not the case of tetanus, but the case of diphtheria. pertussis...

Why? Because with the aP vaccine, immunity is not stimulated enough, as there are less antigens in it to ""irritate"" the immune system and create enough antibodies. Hence you basically become unimmunized. Just like unvaccinated persons. 



This was observed in a trial for animals too. And by this, we get back to your previous ideas that unvaccinated kids are not that much of a danger. They are though, because they become even a bigger reservoir of infection.

>>""However, Merkel notes that there was a ‚Äústartling‚Äù difference in acellular-vaccinated animals: ‚ÄúAfter they were infected, they became colonised and remained colonised longer than unvaccinated animals. Although they weren‚Äôt sick, they were carrying the bacterium in their airways.‚Äù When these animals were co-housed, they were able to infect other, unvaccinated, animals.

>>A similar pattern was seen with whole-cell vaccinated animals, but they were able to clear the infection within two weeks ‚Äî much quicker than the acellular-vaccinated animals. ‚ÄúTo a large extent, this can explain the increase we are seeing in cases of pertussis,‚Äù says Merkel.""

Either way, the conclusion was ok and mentioned that the more there are vaccinated, just like with polio, the less risk of contracting a disease if you have a large percentage of the population vaccinated. It's called herd immunity! And possible eradication. Look at polio, it still can be transmitted through feces, for a while after getting the vaccine. Yet in so many countries it's been eradicated.

Also, the problem is here that both the study you linked and the one I linked, failed to mention the antibody count. They're just mentioning waning immunity, which is not enough for a conclusion. 

This remains my point of argument, to what you said: you're not immunised,  or properly immunised anymore if you manage to colonise a bacteria you're vaccinated against. Aka: you need the booster.",vaccine_myth

"<MoreComments count=0, children=[]>",Comment,,vaccine_myth
fl6mot,"Having a youtube comment debate, how do I respond to this?","1.) The movie they cited as their source, ‚ÄúVaxxed‚Äù, was written by Andrew Wakefield. He is a former UK doctor who was hired by a group of parents to find a link between vaccines and autism. He published a study finding the link in the highly respected medical journal the ‚ÄúLancet‚Äù. It was later found that he falsified the results of his study, and also performed very unethical and invasive tests on children with autism to ‚Äúprove‚Äù his findings (think unnecessary spinal taps and other painful procedures). His was the first, and I believe only, article to be retracted in the Lancet in all its years of publication. Wakefield was stripped of his medical license and ability to continue practicing medicine in the UK. No doctors, in any country, have ever completed a study that replicated his results. An important factor of scientific studies is they need to be repeatable. If nobody else is getting the same results, his study is suspect regardless of the ethics of it (but that‚Äôs a huge deal anyways) I would be HIGHLY skeptical of anything that has his name on it.

2.) The movie Vaxxed is only showing one ‚Äúside‚Äù of the story, if you can call it that. It‚Äôs meant to scare people and to convince them that vaccines are bad. It isn‚Äôt a sound source because it‚Äôs heavily biased and does not present all the information, only the information that supports their narrative.

3.) Vaccine injuries are a real thing. However, they are also incredibly rare. I am not a doctor, or medical professional in any capacity, so I don‚Äôt have hard science for you. But look at the number of people who have been fully vaccinated and compare that to the number of people who have vaccine caused injuries. My entire life, 99% of the people I know are fully vaccinated, and not a single one of them had any impairment attributed to vaccines. I‚Äôd do some research into the actual chances of vaccine injury. But I‚Äôm almost positive that the chances of a vaccine injury are significantly smaller than the chances of injury from other routine or necessary/life saving procedures that we don‚Äôt bat an eye at (think surgeries and the like)

4.) The hole in the logic of anti-Vaxxers that I‚Äôve never heard them answer is this: if you break an arm, where are you going to go? Answer: the doctor‚Äôs. They wouldn‚Äôt think twice about it. I know anti-vaxxers who have rushed their children to the doctor for a high fever. However, they also claim big pharma is a conspiracy and trying to hurt you. If the vaccines aren‚Äôt safe, how can anything the doctor says/does be trusted? Either they are in on the conspiracy or they are dumb enough to be taken in by it, and either way how can you trust them? Also, the FDA approves the vaccines, and they also approve the other meds you might take/a doctor might prescribe you. How can you trust ANY of that if the vaccines are a huge conspiracy? You‚Äôre better off staying away entirely if that‚Äôs the case.

5.) The ingredients in vaccines sound scary, sure. I wouldn‚Äôt trust myself to mix a vaccine safely. However, I am not a doctor. I didn‚Äôt spend years studying medicine, and then following strict procedures and countless peer-reviewed and tested studies to have the know-how to make vaccines. Just like I wouldn‚Äôt trust myself to wire a house, because I have no experience, but I would trust an electrician. Or how I would trust a cardiologist to perform open heart surgery on me but I wouldn‚Äôt trust my husband because he isn‚Äôt a medical professional.

6.) On their whole ‚Äúingestion vs injection‚Äù thing; broccoli is totally safe to ingest. We recommend people ingestion broccoli as it‚Äôs very good for you. We do not recommend people injecting broccoli into their bloodstream. Again, I‚Äôm not a doctor, but injecting broccoli into your body will kill you. Should we get rid of broccoli?

7.) Vaccines seem unnecessary, but it‚Äôs because they work. Vaccines stop the spread of dangerous and even deadly diseases. When enough people vaccinate, it protects the vulnerable populations (elderly, very young, immunocompromised, and those who for one reason or another cannot receive vaccines). The disease cannot spread, causing it to effectively die out, or at least prevents it from becoming a pandemic. This whole Coronavirus thing is actually a good illustration of how bad a pandemic can be and how beneficial these vaccines are. Smallpox, measles, heck even the flu, all used to tear through communities and kill/injure a lot of people. Modern medicine helps, but the vaccines keep it from spreading like wildfire in the first place. When was the last measles epidemic? Or the last smallpox outbreak? We vaccinate for those, and while a case of measles or two might pop up every now and then, we aren‚Äôt shutting down cities because of an outbreak.

What? How did you arrive at this conclusion? Zika was identified in the 1950s and is very similar to its flavivirus cousins (less dangerous than most). Avian flu (H5N1) is literally just one of many flu strains.

The first coronaviruses were identified in the 1960s, and are one of several that cause the common cold. You've almost certainly had a few coronavirus infections over the course of your life.

fgthaab,Comment,"> Their immune system is burdened as well as purged of natural disease detourants.

I don't think there is any evidence for this, and I struggle to imagine any biologically plausible mechanism that would cause this. 

Vaccines are not especially burdensom to the immune system. On the contrary we encounter a dozen novel antigens per day, and at any given point our immune systems are in the process of combating 1000+ different insults (though the vast majority are mostly harmless like pet dander or pollen). 

Moreover, today's vaccination schedule is far less insulting than the one our parents went through. Today's children get more overall needle sticks, but smaller doses each time, and there are fewer novel antigens in said vaccines. In the 1960-70s they had no good way to determine which antigens to target to provoke an immune response, so they basically used brute force. Some vaccines had hundreds even thousands of antigens like the old Pertussis vaccine. Probably only a handful were relevant, but they couldn't isolate them, so they just gave you the whole load. Today we're much better at isolating the relevant ones. 

I saw a paper about this a few years back, IIRC a child born in the 2010s will be exposed to about 150 novel antigens through the CDC recommended vaccination schedule, a kid born in the 1980s probably got 3000, and in larger doses (but fewer shots). We probably get 20,000+ per year naturally anyway. As such, the insult from vaccinations is not that unusual, and in fact, far less significant than actually getting the flu or measles. I don't think there is any evidence that vaccination makes people ""softer"".

While hygiene theory suggest growing up in a sterile environment is a bad thing, there is no evidence that surviving horrible illnesses somehow makes you stronger. In fact, I'd wager the opposite. A serous measles infection for example, can royally screw with your immune system for years. 

As to your question, I can't imagine how getting routine flu and TDAP shots would make you more susceptible to something like SARS or nCov. 

I'd guess modern epidemics are the result of habitat destruction via industrial agriculture, and  reckless slaughter practices, and increased human mobility. The 2014 West Ebola outbreak was not unusual in any biological way, the only thing that changed was that modern Africa is surprisingly well connected with significant flow of goods and people, whereas 1970s Africa was isolated and most Ebola outbreaks were easily contained.",vaccine_myth

Vaccines provide the building blocks for your immune system to properly fight off a virus when it comes into contact with one. It allows your body to make antibodies to these diseases. Generally, without being vaccinated, your body has to have time to make these cell mediated responses and fight off the infection, then it's stored in your immune systems memory.

To belabor the point that this is a pretty vapid comment:

>>Universal HepB vaccination of all infants beginning at birth provides a critical safeguard and prevents infection among infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers not identified prenatally (e.g., in situations where the mother was not tested or when testing, interpretation, or transcription errors occurred).

>>Approximately 88% of commercially insured women and 84% of Medicaid-enrolled women are tested for HBsAg during pregnancy (27). In one study of a large health system in northern California, 93% of HBsAg-positive pregnant women were tested for HBV DNA (28). Most (94.9%) infants born to infected women receive recommended prophylaxis within 12 hours of birth (29). 

>>Universal HepB vaccine birth dose coverage, defined as 1 dose of vaccine administered by 3 days of life, is 71.1% (30), an increase from 50.1% during 2003‚Äì2005 prior to revised ACIP recommendations for the birth dose before hospital discharge (31), but below the Healthy People 2020 target of 85% (32).

So we have [three good reasons](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/67/rr/rr6701a1.htm). First, through failure to identify Hep B positive mothers through two different mechanisms, and for compliance reasons (the baby *is* right there, after all).

Now the UK does it differently. They have both a different healthcare/insurance system, and they also use a hexavalent vaccine rather than monovalent Hep B vaccines. That's two levels of incongruent comparisons, and no particular substantive reason to delay other than if you support lower compliance rates and increased testing failure risks.

Different vaccine, different indications and schedules. Obviously insurance system will affect antenatal care and screenings, which affect the risk/benefit analysis for something like the Hep B vaccine (which, again, is not the same as the vaccine you're mentioning in the UK). It's just a different healthcare system. That there are different immunization schedules isn't particularly surprising or even necessarily meaningful.

>Aren't babies particularly sensitive when they are first borne?

The vaccine is tolerated fine, so I dunno what else this would imply that's worth addressing.

>I was thinking that it makes more sense not to give unneeded vaccines or medications on the first day of life just to improve compliance

It's not ""unneeded"" on day 1 any more than day 60 or day 600. You derive more benefit from earlier vaccination by definition. It also improves compliance because you already have started the schedule, informed the parents, and can test the mother. 

>although if there are testing errors I can understand this

That and screening insufficiencies, etc. 

>Why are you always so hostile?

Why are you always quick to make sweeping and uninformed judgments? I've just got no patience for such nonsense, and if you have any intellectual honesty then you'll grit your teeth, take the lumps where you've earned them, and be better for it.

When citing studies, make sure they don't have major conflicts of interest ***IMPORTANT*** This is NOT the most up to date evidence of the flu vaccine's effectiveness, I only cited this as a source for the fact that industry-funded studies are biased. Here are more up to date reviews:

This isn't remotely in line with FDA approval standards. I also don't see how the Cochrane review in any way justifies your opinion here unless you misunderstand what 'bias' is meant in these reviews.

Edit: So I missed what you're likely referring to with this link, the warning at the bottom of this (and only this) Cochrane review. This review itself has no particular issue with or statement against industry funded studies and, of course, included many. The actual study you're trying to refer to is [this one](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.b354) by another study author on these Cochrane reviews you've cited. Notably these reviews are in line with reported influenza vaccine efficacy which is common, that being ~45%. 

I've taken one example from the 2009 review you have meant to cite as an example (see Wongsurakiat 2004 in Table 2): 

>>Study was conducted over one year. Conclusions support recommendation of annual vaccination (one dose is sufficient in adults, as strong response has been observed). Authors note that vaccine effectiveness has been shown, even if it was possibly administered too late (in region where study was carried out peak incidence of influenza occurs usually in May).

All totally in line with their results. They have strong evidence of an effect even with a later administration. Seasonal homogeneity isn't uncommon, so this is a bizarre complaint against strong statistical results and completely 'concordant' summary in the conclusion. In fact, the delayed administration of the first dose still being effective is totally in line with rapid waning of influenza vaccine efficacy. Plus the patients had a second booster dose which is not normally recommended for adults, further maintaining higher titer levels into the next season. On a cynical reading, one might think that patients sick in May were included even though vaccination began in June. In reality, given the study was conducted for a full calendar year which simply rolled over a month after 'normal peak' season, this means that vaccination began in June of 1997, included May 1998 (peak season) and went through October 1998. 

>>Comment: though authors state that effectiveness is shown for influenza related ARI only, and not influenza, they recommend vaccination for patients with COPD. 

Because it demonstrated statistically significant reduction for influenza related ARI or, as referred to in the study, ILI. 

>>This means recommending vaccine though it is not effective against influenza and acute exacerbations. 

Misleading or incorrect wording. The Cochrane authors are distinguishing ILI and laboratory confirmed influenza virus infection (causing the pathology 'influenza'). As the original authors state, viral propagation from infection was only possible in 10% of those patients with ILI presentation. The paper does *not* demonstrate a *lack* of efficacy, but only *fails* to demonstrate *presence* of efficacy for lab confirmed influenza. Yet considering the serology confirmed increase in antibody titer, strong reduction in ILI, and lack of effect against non-influenza ARI, this is a terrible mischaracterization of the study and its conclusions. Usually there is no ability to distinguish between flu-ARI and non-flu-ARI. However in this case other viral agents were confirmed, giving much higher confidence in proper ILI designation. 

>>In addition, lack of comment on community viral circulation and vaccine content and matching make verification of effectiveness against ARI impossible.

I have no idea what the Cochrane authors are saying here. Wongsurakiat et al *do* comment on circulating virus among the community, *do* comment on vaccine content, and *do* make a matching verification. The predominantly circulating type A flu was H3N2 at the time, of which the vaccine component was stated to be on target, and of which the majority of confirmed flu in the study was confirmed to be type A. moreover, they confirm specific titer increases for the study subjects in line with well-known protective level thresholds. And, finally, the authors *don't* suggest the vaccine has effect against ARI--that is to say all acute respiratory infections--and instead say it is true for *only* influenza-ARI. 

This being a prime example in their table of discordance...I'm extremely disappointed. The Cochrane authors seem to dispute the sensitive nature of COPD patients to airway exacerbations and wholly ignore this supreme risk factor which any responsible clinician must weigh (risk) against perceived benefit of the vaccine (reward). See this excerpt:

>>All the unvaccinated patients with moderate-to-severe
COPD who were hospitalized because of influenzarelated ARI required mechanical ventilation. One of
these patients with severe COPD died because of
ventilator-associated pneumonia. In contrast, none
of the vaccinated patients required mechanical ventilatory support because of ARI related to influenza
virus infection.

Now, these results might not be statistically significant, but they aren't evidence of it being ""not effective against influenza and acute exacerbations"" like the Cochrane authors state. Are the Cochrane authors *really* disputing the idea that influenza vaccination proved effective against ILI? Or are they just harping on the lack of distinction between ILI and lab-confirmed influenza? Because one of those questions has an obvious and practical answer for clinicians, and the other is an academic or philosophical exercise. I'm either missing something big, or this is a huge oversight on the part of the Cochrane authors. Cochrane authors are humans the same as all the other study authors. To conclude that industry funded studies are completely unreliable is not 'concordant' with the Cochrane authors themselves.",vaccine_myth

Pro vaccine choice individuals are the ones calling for more study and scientific progress. It is usually the ones that call for more vaccination that have the hubris to believe the science is settled and we know everything there is to know about the human body and the immune system.  

It is the ones against vaccine choice that have the arrogance to demand everyone follow what they believe regardless of the individuals hurt along the way. The belief that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and that the nation state should be allowed to tell an individual what to inject into their body are fascist ideals.

Fascism - anti-intellectual, anti-democratic, individual interests are subordinated to the good of the nation, forcibly suppresses opposition and criticism, regiments industry, commerce, etc., emphasizes an aggressive nationalism and often racism. 

AKA taking away an individual‚Äôs right to choose what is injected into their body despite numerous side effects and subjecting them to mass experimentation for ‚Äúthe good of the nation‚Äù while really just backing the ever growing pharmaceutical industry and suppressing any information that contradicts their interests. 

So even if you don‚Äôt agree don‚Äôt force your ideals on others.

f8trl9l,Comment,">Why is this mom excited about the chicken pox?

Probably because chickenpox is more serious for adults than children, and is a virus that can build up long term immunity, so she is hoping that by getting chickenpox now will prevent a more serious case of chickenpox when the kids are older

>Is it not dangerous?

Serious complications are not common, 1 in 300-500 chickenpox cases requires hospitalization and 1 in 60,000 results in death [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#complications](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#complications)

>My kids are both fully vaccinated (4 and 2 years old), are they protected?

No guarantee, the vaccine is not 100% effective, and the second dose isn't given until age 4-6, so it is still best to keep your kids away from sick people until they are no longer sick. According to the CDC a person with chickenpox is no longer contagious 24 hours after that last new spot appears, which shouldn't be more than a week or so after the start of symptoms

>Arent your risk of getting shingles greatly increased if you have had the chicken pox?

Yes, it is pretty much impossible to get shingles if you haven't had chickenpox or a chickenpox vaccine

>I am pregnant but had them as a kid, am i protected?

This is probably a question for your doctor, but there is no guarantee, and live vaccines such as chickenpox aren't recommended for pregnant women, so avoid exposure to infected people especially while pregnant, as harm to the fetus is possible [https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#complications](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/varicella.html#complications)

>If anti vaxxers get excited that your body builds natural immunity after having the disease, isnt that what vaccines do for your body except your never ""sick""?

Yes, (well you can still get a little sick) but antivaxers are concerned about combinations of viruses in one vaccine, multiple vaccines at the same them, and chemical additives (although most of the chemical additives of concern are only used for vaccines against things that you can't build up immunity to from catching them)",vaccine_myth
e1l9oc,A mom friend is excited her kids got chicken pox,"So I‚Äôll answer this as best I can, I am neither a doctor or an anti-vaxxer so anyone feel free to correct me/add on if I‚Äôm wrong:

The mom is excited about her kids getting chicken pox because basically once you‚Äôve had chicken pox you‚Äôre unlikely (or immune, not 100% sure which) to get it again. Before the chicken pox vaccine it was common to try to get your kids exposed to chicken pox young because I believe the older you are the worse it is. So basically she‚Äôs trying to prevent her kids from getting it worse by exposing them young. Which would make sense except we have a vaccine so they never have to get it at all.

The point of vaccines isn‚Äôt just to protect you. It protects immunocompromised people who will her can‚Äôt get the vaccine, or can but are otherwise at risk of getting sick anyways. Two of my siblings are on immunosuppressants for other conditions they have. Despite being fully vaccinated, they get sick super easy and when they get sick it‚Äôs way worse because their immune systems are shot. So, like I said before, before the vaccine it made sense to expose your kids young to head off a worse infection later. Now, however, there‚Äôs no need to encourage the spread of a disease that could be dangerous for certain people groups (immunocompromised, elderly, young children, pregnant women, etc.).

The whole ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù thing that anti-vaxxers like to tout is not really what they make it sound like. They like to say your body is naturally able to fight off infection/keep you from getting sick. Which is true, to an extent, but when your kid gets chicken pox they don‚Äôt have a ‚Äúnatural immunity‚Äù to chicken pox. They still got chicken pox. It‚Äôs not like your body miraculously protects you from ever getting sick.

If you are concerned about your own health, I‚Äôd talk to your doctor. Since you are pregnant you can get sick easier. My personal, NOT MEDICAL, recommendation would be to stay away from your friend/her kids/her husband/etc until the chicken pox completely clears their house. Again, ask your doctor what they recommend, but I think steering clear is the safest bet here since you DON‚ÄôT want chicken pox and pregnancy at the same time. That sounds terrible! Also remember that just because someone is not showing symptoms does not mean they aren‚Äôt carrying the disease. I‚Äôm not 100% sure how chicken pox spreads, so again please please talk to your doctor, but if your friend isn‚Äôt sick she may still be able to spread the disease to you.

As far as shingles goes, I think maybe having chicken pox as a kid makes you more likely to get it but I don‚Äôt think you have to have had chicken pox to get it. Again, not 100% sure here so hopefully someone smarter is able to fill this in!

Shingles is an infection with the same virus as chickenpox, and can only happen if you have been exposed to the virus at some point in the past, and are not immune, it is usually a reactivation of the virus decades after chickenpox (no you are not contagious for all those decades) but shingles has been know to occur directly following exposure to the virus, and as a result of the vaccine virus as well",vaccine_myth

Note the ‚Äúno decline in transmission‚Äù below 

According to a Cochrane review the flu vaccine IF it has the correct strains circulating reduces the likelihood of catching the flu from 4% if unvaccinated to 1% if vaccinated. A 3% risk difference. So not much of a benefit there. Also the study concluded that there is no evidence that the flu vaccine affect complications, such as pneumonia, or transmission. The CDC combines pneumonia rates with flu rates to estimate the number of deaths from the flu, creating extremely exaggerated numbers to push the flu vaccine when the flu vaccine doesn‚Äôt reduce rates of pneumonia.

And...

The Myth of Herd Immunity
The Myth of Herd Immunity leads us to believe that unvaccinated populations will bring back epidemics of deadly diseases. This myth also makes us believe that:
1. Unvaccinated children are a threat to society and
2. Unvaccinated children pose a risk to vaccinated children.
I‚Äôll tackle this whole discombobulated mess of a myth in one post, through the research, knowledge, science, & expertise of a doctor, a pediatrician, & a neurosurgeon.
What are we told?
* We often hear statements from public health officials like ‚ÄúClusters of unvaccinated children are not only in potential danger themselves, but are also a threat to the herd immunity‚Äù.
* Authorities argue that parents should vaccinate their children to protect society as a whole from epidemics.
* According to public health officials, ‚Äúparents who reject vaccines don‚Äôt consider the effect of their child on the rest of society‚Äù.
* We are told that for the shots to work, everyone must play along. And parents who decline the vaccines, are somehow reaping the benefits from those who are vaccinated.
What is truth?¬†
Dr. O‚ÄôShea, in his book: ‚ÄúVaccination is Not Immunization‚Äù explains:¬† ‚ÄúDo not make the error of many pediatricians or journalists who talk about herd immunity as though it refers to the immunity that proceeds from a large group of people being vaccinated. The calculated deception behind this common misnomer is that if you don‚Äôt know what herd immunity is, you‚Äôll buy their illusion: that the unvaccinated child can take advantage of the herd who have been vaccinated. This is well though-out propaganda. True herd immunity is a term which indicates that a disease has burned itself out within a population, as with plague, smallpox, typhus-every infectious disease in history. The herd has become immune. Natural selection. It has to do with nature, not with manmade vaccines. Don‚Äôt be fooled again‚Äù
Dr. Palevsky (board-certified pediatrician) explains: ‚ÄúThis whole concept of herd immunity is very interesting, because we were taught that herd immunity occurs because a certain percentage of a population gets an active illness. Therefore by a certain percentage of getting the active illness, they impart a protection onto the remaining part of the population that has not gotten the illness yet. And so the herd that is getting the illness is shedding the illness and protecting those who have not gotten it.""
In vaccine science, we are extrapolating or concluding that if we vaccinate a certain percentage of people, we are imparting protection on those who have not been vaccinated. And that has NOT been shown to be true, because the true herd immunity in theory is based on an ACTIVE DISEASE, and we know that despite what we‚Äôre taught, vaccination does not mimic the natural disease.
Thus, we cannot use the same model of herd immunity in a natural disease in the vaccination policy. This does not stop the press, every single year.
The entire concept of herd immunity fails to acknowledge that there is a life cycle of the viruses and the bacteria all on their own, and that what turns them on and off may have nothing to do with the percentage of people who have been infected.
By failing to include that viruses have a life cycle, and that they are in relationship to other organisms and to us, we are missing the main point. It is preposterous to think that a child who is vaccinated no longer carries the bacteria or the viruses that they have been vaccinated against. That is the whole point of vaccines.
So Once You Are Vaccinated, You Are Part of the Herd. Right?
Dr. Blaylock (board certified neurosurgeon) explains:¬†
‚ÄúIn the original description of herd immunity, the protection to the population at large occurred only if people contracted the infections naturally. The reason is that naturally acquired immunity lasts for a lifetime. Vaccine proponents quickly latched onto this concept and applied it to vaccine-induced immunity.¬†But there was one major problem: Vaccine-induced immunity lasts for only a relatively short period‚Ä¶
This is why they quietly began to suggest ¬†boosters for most vaccines, even the common childhood infections such as chickenpox, measles, mumps, and rubella.
Then they discovered an even greater problem: The boosters were lasting for only two years or less. This is why we are now seeing mandates that youth entering colleges have multiple vaccines, even those that they insisted gave lifelong immunity, such as the MMR. The same is being suggested for full-grown adults. Ironically, no one in the media or medical field is asking what is going on. They just accept that it must be done.
That vaccine-induced herd immunity is mostly myth can be proven quite simply. We all were told for over 70 years that vaccine immunity lasts a lifetime. It was not until relatively recently that it was discovered that most of these vaccines lost their effectiveness 2 to 10 years after being given.
What this means is that at least half the population, that is the baby boomers, have had no vaccine-induced immunity against any of these diseases for which they had been vaccinated very early in life. At least 50 percent of the population has been unprotected for decades.
If we listen to present-day wisdom, we are all at risk of resurgent massive epidemics should the vaccination rate fall below 95 percent. Yet we have all lived for at least 30 to 40 years with 50 percent or less of the population having vaccine protection.
Herd immunity has not existed in this country for many decades, and no resurgent epidemics have occurred. Vaccine-induced herd immunity is a lie used to frighten doctors, public-health officials, other medical personnel, and the public into accepting vaccinations‚Äù.
Where is the Logic?
Take Pertussis (whooping cough) Dr. Palevsky explains this very well:
Do children vaccinated with the pertussis vaccine somehow stop carrying pertussis bacteria in their airways simply because they‚Äôve been vaccinated? NO
Do pertussis vaccines stop vaccinated children from transmitting the pertussis bacteria to other people? NO
Do pertussis bacteria disappear from society once vaccination rates are high? NO: Vaccination rates for pertussis have no impact on whether the pertussis bacteria are in the air or not, or whether or not we breathe them in. The presence of the pertussis bacteria, and the exposure to them, are in no way affected by vaccination status or vaccination rates.
Do unvaccinated children, because they are unvaccinated, carry the bacteria in their airways, which vaccinated children are somehow no longer believed to be carrying because they‚Äôve been vaccinated? NO
Do unvaccinated children transmit the pertussis bacteria to other children by the mere fact that they are not vaccinated? NO: Air is air. Air is free to breathe. We breathe in whatever is in the air. And, vaccinated and unvaccinated children are equally exposed to breathing in pertussis bacteria.
Anyone who poses as science the idea that unvaccinated children pose a threat to the population because they are unvaccinated and are more likely to transmit a disease to the rest of the population, is misleading you, promulgating myth, and inaccurate. Vaccination with the pertussis vaccine does not exonerate anyone from carrying the pertussis bacteria, or prevent them from being exposed to the bacteria.
Unvaccinated children do not walk around carrying secret viruses and bacteria that no-one else has. An unvaccinated child with measles has no greater chance of spreading measles than a vaccinated child with measles would.",vaccine_myth

Scientific progress always takes a long time.

This is how we reward people who question the status quo and seek progress, especially when it may bring to light that Drs may be unwittingly harming patients by following that status quo. 

Pro vaccine choice individuals are the ones calling for more study and scientific progress. It is usually the ones that call for more vaccination that have the hubris to believe the science is settled and we know everything there is to know about the human body and the immune system.  

It is the ones against vaccine choice that have the arrogance to demand everyone follow what they believe regardless of the individuals hurt along the way. The belief that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and that the nation state should be allowed to tell an individual what to inject into their body are fascist ideals.

Fascism - anti-intellectual, anti-democratic, individual interests are subordinated to the good of the nation, forcibly suppresses opposition and criticism, regiments industry, commerce, etc., emphasizes an aggressive nationalism and often racism. 

AKA taking away an individual‚Äôs right to choose what is injected into their body despite numerous side effects and subjecting them to mass experimentation for ‚Äúthe good of the nation‚Äù while really just backing the ever growing pharmaceutical industry and suppressing any information that contradicts their interests.

>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/22895945/

The metaanalysis puts all flu and ILI in one pot, so it's irrelevant. Not all ILI are flu and not all flu are deadly. It doesn't mean 

1: **AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccines are efficacious in preventing cases of influenza in children older than two years of age, but little evidence is available for children younger than two years of age.**


No studies on this, doesn't make it less efficient. 

2: **There was a difference between vaccine efficacy and effectiveness, partly due to differing datasets, settings and viral circulation patterns.**

Oh no, who would've thought, you moron, that strains cannot be matched every single year. Of course that a virus with increased mutagenic shifts will not be matched for the vaccine every year. Nobody claimed anything different. That doesn't make the vaccine itself harmful. What the fuck are you on about? Are you doing meth?

As a former epidemiologist, I'm ashamed to read  Jefferson T's  ""review"" about the influenza vaccine. He uses SO FUCKING MANY fallacies. He doesn't take into account even the morbidity or mortality of the flu and claims that not even pregnant women should be vaccinated, because the less you do medical acts on them, the better. That's outrageous and bizarre as fuck. Do we live in 2019 or 1900?

Do you even fucking know how flu pandemics wiped millions of people in 1919? Just look up Spanish flu.

I'm sure those people would rather get a low antibody count from a vaccine, than fucking none. 40% less deaths is better than what happened then.

https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/one-flu-into-the-cuckoos-nest/

Read some more about how much of an imbecile JT is. You should feel as stupid as this guy is.


>https://marshfieldresearch.org/News/clinic-researchers-study-finds-prior-flu-season-vaccines-may-provide-residual-protection

You said that the flu shot is less and less efficient if you get it every year.

Again, your reading comprehension is out of this world. And that's not good. Cause you don't seem to be having a human brain.

They said:

""Researchers found adults had similar levels of protection if they received the flu vaccine in the current season, the previous season or both seasons. They also found that vaccine effectiveness was 27-41 percent higher for adults who were vaccinated for the first time in the past five years, compared to those who got the vaccine almost every year. She said reasons for the increase in effectiveness is not yet clear and more research is needed to understand how repeated flu vaccination affects the immune system.""

You know what that means, mister scientific method? That means THAT NO CORRELATION WAS FOUND.

SO WHERE'S YOUR FUCKING HARD PROOF, WHERE'S YOUR EVIDENCE? 


I really hope you don't reproduce and just so you know, logical fallacies don't confirm your bullshit. Yes, science evolves. But vaccines are proof that science also works and it's better to prevent, unlike your claims that drs don't want that, than to treat. Or bury your patients. 

>AKA taking away an individual‚Äôs right to choose what is injected into their body despite numerous side effects

Side effects from inactivated vaccines are mild and rarely occurring. I guess you'd like to see people suffering from a disease instead of admitting that your lack of chemistry and physiology knowledge is null. Like your smooth brain.

Of course low efficacy doesn‚Äôt make them more harmful. But it does change the risk benefit analysis. 

Of course not all ILI are flu. Only about 3% - 9% of suspected flu cases are actually flu. The flu vaccine is less effective because as you admit ‚Äústrains cannot be matched every single year. Of course that a virus with increased mutagenic shifts will not be matched for the vaccine every year.‚Äù So all the ILI are used to promote flu vaccines but vaccines may reduce 10-30% of 3-9% of ‚Äúflu‚Äù cases.

Um, no.  What they said was there was a correlation found they just don‚Äôt know why the efficacy is lower after repeated vaccination and more study was needed. 

I have smart amazing unvaccinated children. Thank you for asking. 

Vaccine side effects are not rare. They are suppressed. There is a difference. 

Vaccines are labeled ‚Äúunavoidably unsafe‚Äù by the US Supreme Court and were protected from judicial oversight through legal channels (National Child Vaccine Injury Act in 1986), this took away legal channels for discovery and safety review. This happened because so many people said vaccines were injuring their loved ones.

The population at large is told adverse reactions are rare and not to worry about them. So Drs and patients alike do not know the risks and do not see a connection between their health issues and the vaccines they‚Äôve received. (The majority of vaccine recipients are too young to tell us if they are experiencing side effects). If no one is looking at or tracking the risks then how can you say they‚Äôve got a safe track record. We are not healthier overall and without a definitive cause for the health concerns it is irresponsible to say definitively that vaccines are not the cause.

Vaccine adverse events 1) compensated in vaccine court: Guillain-Barr√© syndrome, transverse myelitis, encephalopathy, seizure disorder, death, brachial neuritis, acute disseminated encephalomylites, Chronic inflammatory demyelination, polyradiculoneuropathy (CIPD), premature ovarian failure, Bell‚Äôs palsy, juvenile diabetes, idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, infantile spasms, anaphylaxis, ocular myasthenia gravis, hypoxic seizure.

2) listed on vaccine inserts: Autoimmune diseases, allergies, asthma, eczema, tics, Tourette‚Äôs syndrome, ADD / ADHD, autism, speech delay, neurodevelopment disorder, SIDS, narcolepsy.

When an automated reporting system analyzed data reported over a 3 yr period it found that adverse reactions could be 26:1,000 or approximately 1 in 38.

http://healthimpactnews.com/2017/harvard-immunologist-to-legislators-unvaccinated-children-pose-zero-risk-to-anyone/ ‚ÄúA recent study done in Ontario, Canada, established that vaccination actually leads to an emergency room visit for 1 in 168 children following their 12-month vaccination appointment and for 1 in 730 children following their 18-month vaccination appointment¬†(see appendix for a scientific study, Item #5).‚Äù

1 in 640 have a seizure from mmr https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/measles/vrs/

https://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/vaccines/mmrv/mmrv-febrile-seizures.html
‚ÄúThe rate of seizures in this timeframe was 85 per 1000 person-years in the MMRV vaccine group compared to 42 per 1000 in the MMR and varicella vaccine group. This risk was about 2 times higher in children who received the combination shot (MMRV) versus the single shots (MMR and varicella).‚Äù

‚ÄúApproximately 40 cases of death and permanent injury from the MMR vaccine are reported to VAERS annually‚Äù and only about 1-10% of adverse events are reported. So that could mean approximately 400-4000 deaths or permanent injuries from the mmr vaccine annually.

‚ÄúAs of March 31, 2018, there have been more than 89,355 reports of measles vaccine reactions, hospitalizations, injuries and deaths following measles vaccinations made to the federal Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), including 445 related deaths, 6,196 hospitalizations, and 1,657 related disabilities. Over 60% of those adverse events occurred in children three years old and under.‚Äù https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/measles/vrs/

After automating adverse event reports at Harvard Pilgrim, the developers of this system asked the CDC to take the final step of linking VAERS with the Harvard Pilgrim system so that these reports could be automatically transmitted into VAERS. Instead, the CDC refused to cooperate. As the Harvard grant recipients explained: Unfortunately, there was never an opportunity to perform system performance assessments because the necessary CDC contacts were no longer available and the CDC consultants responsible for receiving data were no longer responsive to our multiple requests to proceed with testing and evaluation. After three years and spending $1 million of taxpayers‚Äô money, the CDC refused to even communicate with the HHS‚Äô Harvard Medical School grant recipients. While HHS generally strongly supports automating public health surveillance systems, when it comes to vaccine safety, the CDC has only supported projects that would limit VAERS to passive surveillance. Automation would improve safety and address many of the long-standing issues and limitations raised by CDC regarding VAERS.37 Capturing ‚Äúfewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events‚Äù thirty years after the passage of the 1986 Act is unacceptable ‚Äì and potentially deadly. https://icandecide.org/wp-content/uploads/whitepapers/VaccineSafety-Version-1.0-October-2-2017.pdf",vaccine_myth

Example for the rotavirus vaccine

>A key ethical aspect considered when adopting the placebo-controlled design was that the risks of withholding rotavirus vaccine could be (and were) mitigated by rehydration counselling and regular check-ups. 


Another problem with that is that these vaccines were proven over and over again that they are effective. And there are multiple methods to do that without risking someone's lives. Like testing for antibodies. It's simple, it's effective, it doesn't cost that much, especially not a life!

>Against this backdrop, the WHO Department of Ethics and Social Determinants convened an expert consultation to provide recommendations on the use of placebo controls in vaccine trials in cases where an efficacious vaccine already exists. 

See? It's not like the dropped the vaccines on the market and then let them do damage and hope for the best. The vaccines were extensively tested anyway, so yeah, now maybe they can have some placebo tests done, if it doesn't risk... let's say, an infant's life. But they don't even need to do that. They just have to use an unvaccinated cohort (and they can find that for sure, either because of poverty, lack of vaccines, etc) and compare the results.

For the other thing: https://www.skepticalraptor.com/skepticalraptorblog.php/aluminum-and-vaccines-its-time-to-clear-up-the-pseudoscience/

First it was ""mercury"" or thimerosal, which is a salt of mercury. Now it's aluminium. They're just moving goal posts. 

The dose makes the poison. From a 0,5 ml dose of a vaccine, aluminium will not be in such a high quantity and it will be eliminated from the body within 72 h and wouldn't be able to travel anywhere, since it's injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly. 

In fact, it stays there, irritates the skin, draws white blood cells to it and then will help create a higher immune response than a vaccine without it. That's it.

and i don't care what a WHO expert panel says, the WHO being a huge part of the pro vaccine push, despite refusal to do proper studies, so why should i listen to an appeal to authority, to an agency, that literally throws oil in the fire of fear of people against people, who are educated and refuse to vaccinate.

Ethylmercury (sometimes ethyl mercury) is a cation composed of an organic CH3CH2- species (an ethyl group) bound to a mercury(II) centre, making it a type of organometallic cation, and giving it a chemical formula is C2H5Hg+. It is one of the metabolites of thiomersal (thimerosal or sodium ethyl mercuric thiosalicylate), which is used as a preservative in some vaccines. The term ""ethylmercury"" is also sometimes used as a generic term to describe organomercury compounds which include the ethylmercury functional group, such as ethylmercury chloride and ethylmercury urea.

Yes. Have you considered the possibility the dose in vaccines can make the poison in some individuals? Both aluminum and thimerosal are acknowledged as neurotoxins.

dnsss8,Vaccines are bad and we should ban them,"It's funny that. In England & Wales from 1901 to 1970 sudden and inexplicable deaths in under 4 year old's was a rarity with just a few cases per year. In 1961 the first measles vaccine was trialed here. 1961 saw a higher than ever reported morbidity of measles and a higher than average mortality, the 5 years prior to this we weren't even seeing 100 deaths per year which was quite the achievement given at the start of the century we were seeing up to >13,000 in a year, in 1961 we saw 152 deaths. 1962 they seemed to step back. No reports of any tests and the numbers showed it. Case rates plummeted, as did mortality. 1963, they officially star to use the first measles vaccine. Again, we see morbidity and mortality rise:

Year	Cases	Deaths

1956	160,556	    28

1957	633,678	    94

1958	259,308	    49

1959	539,524	    98

1960	159,364	    31

**1961	763,531	   152**

1962	184,895	    39

**1963	601,255	   127**

**1964	306,801	    73**

**1965	502,209	   115**

**1966	343,642	    80**

**1967	460,407	    99**

If you look at the history of measles mortality, you see a pattern develop - low then high. Over the decades, mortality bombed. No NHS, no antibiotics, no vaccine, just improved living and better understanding. When you look at 1956 to 1960 and compare that to how the drop was constant up until this point, there was nothing in nature that should have allowed mortality to rise the way it did, the **only** difference during these times was the measles vaccine. Mortality was almost double what it should have been during these times.

In 1968 an *improved* vaccine is released and measles rates settle. Uptake is slow, however, the interesting thing is the rise in sudden and inexplicable deaths in children under the age of 4 from 1970. Prior to 1970, there were 2, maybe 3 if any deaths in under 4's which couldn't be explained.

**Sudden and unexplained deaths in under 4's:**

**1961 -** 0

**1962 -** 0

**1963 -** 0

**1964 -** 1

**1965 -** 1

**1966 -** 0

**1967 -** 0

**1968 -** 1

**1969 -** 2

**1970 -** 51

**1971 -** 250

**1972 -** 454

**1973 -** 581

**1974 -** 600

**1975 -** 634

**1976 -** 626

They didn't link fluoride to reduced IQ in children, they found that doses higher than drinking water (and slightly above EATING toothpaste, which it's clear not to) can act as a teratogen and damage the child during a pregnancy. 

Since your post asks about Mercury, I'll explain that a little more. Elemental mercury isn't the same as organic mercury. If your only chemistry background was in high school or not even then, it's understandable that you may not fully understand this. 

Methanol, HOCH3, is extremely poisonous to humans on low doses. Ethanol, HO(CH3)2, so off by just a saturated carbon, is drinking alcohol. Not safe, but not poisonous at moderate doses. That's just a couple atoms. 

A better example might even be oxygen. Breathing in the oxygen you do, diatomic oxygen, O2, is MUCH different than elemental or ionic oxygen. One let's you live, the other rips apart DNA. That's just a couple electrons. 

The best example, as always, is table salt. Sodium in it's elemental,uncharged, +0 state explodes in reaction with water. Chlorine in it's elemental, uncharged form is an incredibly poisonous gas. But guess what? When these are combined, or for specificty's sake, one electron is removed from each, they become a flavorful, harmless salt. That's one electron that separates an explosive sodium with a dissolvable sodium ion. 

In that same spirit, the mercury that used to be in vaccines wasn't in elemental form. It was in this compound.
 https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Thiomersal.svg/1200px-Thiomersal.svg.png

That looks pretty complex, right? The way molecules are structured doesn't allow for atoms to ""be themselves"" when in a compound. Mercury here (in it's +2 state) can't do what we all know elemental mercury, or even worse, methylmercury, can do. It can't just break free and be a dangerous atom. The resonance forms from the ring as well as the heavy metal salt component make it a completely unique compound; not just the sum of its parts. It's much more complex than that.

You are committing an ad hominem fallacy by attempting to discredit me as a person rather than point out the flaw in my supposedly ignorant comment

I am aware that toxicity depends on dose, method of delivery, and adjuvants (kudos for recognizing method of delivery, many people ignore than one), but my point remains that exposure to most mercury compounds presents a risk of mercury toxicity, and such compounds are generally hazardous to handle unless extremely dilute 

I agree that vaccines do not cause mercury toxicity, as any mercury in them is a very small amount, but your claim that elemental mercury is more toxic than organic mercury is simply not true, and the comparison to table salt was a poor analogy

Explain, because, you need to be pretty specific if you're outright negating the foundations of biochemistry. 

To address your assertion that I'm wrong about mercury, I'm not. Here's an objective fact: elemental mercury as well as short-chain carbon derivatives are almost always more toxic that higher level mercury complexes due to reduced biochemical interaction opportunities and reduced ligand affinity.

f0xkdgl,Comment,"It stemmed from an article published by Dr. Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues back in the 1998 in the UK.

In the study, Wakefield looked at 12 children with gastrointestinal issues also had neurological deficits. Eight of those children received the MMR vaccine. He concluded the article saying they couldn't prove a connection between the MMR vaccine and the gastrointestinal issues because the evidence is inadequate. Nowhere in the article he said there was a link between autism and the vaccine, until Wakefield claimed that it did in a press conferences.

His article was published in *the Lancet*, a well-known medicinal journal, and he was known to be a prestigious and highly regarded doctor( he's the doctor who identify the cause of Crohn's disease), so when the public heard of the vaccine-autism link, the public ate it up, fear arose, and vaccination rates dropped.

The article and his claims are farfetch once you look at the detail. First, the size of his studies was too small, only 12 children, making any connection seem statistically significant. There was only a few variables were studies and according to him, those 12 children exhibited forms of autism (the symptoms were not akin to autism). Not only that, his study didn't have the Ethical Practice Committee approve the study, which is necessary to ensure that the research doesn't harm its participants.

What's worse it that it was discovered after much denial that Wakefield was being funded $800,000 by a personal injury lawyer named Richard Barr, who needed evidence that autism was caused by vaccine for cases of parents of autistic children who were suing pharmaceutical companies for compensation. Five of the 12 children were even clients of Barr. Wakefield's collaborators didn't even know about the money and were furious enough to retract their names for the study. But Wakefield had another motive. He advocated that vaccines need to be safe and tells the public that the current MMR vaccine isn't safe. Prior to his study, he was applying for a vaccine patent, he wanted to make his own MMR vaccine and wanted to get rid of the completion.

Wakefield had his medical license evoked in 2005. This should have been the end of the myth, but sadly no. He moved to the USA and is still highly regarded by people. Now his MMR and autism phase is dying down, but his new topic takes the spotlight, mercury in vaccines.",vaccine_myth

>The occurrence of encephalopathy after whole-cell pertussis vaccination has been an issue of intense scrutiny and debate. Often cited are the National Childhood Encephalopathy Study conducted in UK from 1976 to 1979 and the Institute of Medicine (IOM) report (1994). The initial findings of the National Encephalopathy study were that acute encephalopathy occurred at a rate of 1 per 310,000 to 5,300,000 doses (95% CI 54,000 to 5,310,000). Subsequent investigations and follow-up of the affected children then cast some doubt on these initial findings and demonstrated no increase in the rate of death or other sequelae after a DTwP vaccine (Edwards et al., 2008). However, despite these revised findings this has been an area of ongoing controversy. In 1994, the IOM concluded that ‚Äúthe balance of evidence is consistent with a causal relationship between DTwP and chronic nervous system dysfunction in children whose serious acute neurological illness occurred within 7 days of a DTwP vaccination‚Äù. This may imply that the vaccine rarely may trigger such an event in an individual who may be predisposed to develop such a condition because of an underlying abnormality. The IOM committee concluded that the evidence is insufficient to indicate either the presence or absence of a causal relationship between DTwP vaccine and permanent neurological damage (Cowan et al.,1993). More recent studies do not confirm an association between DTwP and acute encephalopathy. A population-based case-control study has evaluated the association between serious acute neurological illness and receipt of whole-cell pertussis vaccine, given as diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTwP) vaccine. The estimated odds ratio for children with encephalopathy or complicated seizures was 3.6 (95% CI, 0.8 to 15.2). The study concluded that there was no statistically significant increased risk of serious acute neurological illness in the 7 days after DTwP vaccine exposure (Gale et al., 1994). A retrospective case-control study performed at four health maintenance organizations by examining children aged 0 to 6 years who were hospitalized with encephalopathy or related conditions determined that cases were no more likely than controls to have received a DTwP vaccine during the 90 days before disease onset. When encephalopathy of known etiology was excluded, the odds ratio for case children having received DTP within 7 days before onset of disease was 1.22 (95% CI, 0.45-3.31, P = 0.693) compared with control children. The study concluded that DTwP vaccination was not associated with an increased risk of encephalopathy (Ray et al., 2006).",vaccine_myth

f0ggfo3,Comment,"When reading the ingredients that are in vaccines, it is understanding why many parents want to avoid preservatives with names like aluminum hydroxide and  formaldehyde. But without those preservatives, vaccines will have a very short shelf life and then afterward inefficient.  Parents may question if that's enough reason to expose their children to poison. I wanted to reassure and inform that those ingredients are harmless, despite its name and known uses, because of its dosage.

Anything in the world can act as a poison or be completely harmless depending on the dosage. So just because something sounds good or bad doesn't mean that any dosage of it remains so. For example, too much vitamin A can actually poison you and damage your liver.

Here is a list of some ingredients in vaccines and their dosage, as well as some usages:

* Aluminum hydroxide: Used as a adjuvant (helps with efficacy of vaccine) in the DTap (0.625 mg). Also used antacids and in infant formula (0.225 mg per liter).
* Formaldehyde: Prevent growth of harmful bacteria in vaccine. All vaccine combined has 1.2 mg of it, while 1 kg of bananas has 16.3 mg.
* Monosodium Glutamate: Help preserve vaccines and used as a flavor enhancer. Some flu vaccines contain 0.188 mg of MSG, while grape juice can contain 0.258 mg per 100 grams.
* Sodium Chloride: Another name for salt and some vaccine have them to keep them in a state that will not badly affect the cells.
* Sorbitol: Preservative, found naturally in fruits, and also used a sweetener in sugar-free products. MMR vaccine has 15 mg and 1 stick of sugar-free gum has 1.25 g.",vaccine_myth

But mercury has different forms. The one that is dangerous is methylmercury. In terms of chemistry, it is the combination of a mercury atom to one carbon atom. It is known to be very dangerous to all living beings. Out of all forms of mercury, methylmercury is absorbed the easily and can even cross the blood brain barrier. Since, there are tiny tiny doses of it in contaminated food, like fish, which is why pregnant women are told to avoid seafood.

I wanted to clarify that methylmercury was never used in vaccines. While thimerosal does have mercury, it is not methylmercury. It is ethlymercury.

Ethlymercury has two carbon atoms, instead of one, which drastically changes its properties and abilities. Due to its size, it's hard for it to cross the blood brain barrier and it's quickly excreted.

Despite this, in 2002, thimerosal was removed from nearly all vaccines due to, not under the prove that it is harmful, but the idea that is has the potential for harm from the general public. This might have been due because of an article called ""Autism: A Novel Form of Mercury Poisoning"" . It was published by a group of parents in the 2001 that linked autism to mercury poisoning and the thimerosal was to blame.

Summary)

Well, many many scientists believe vaccines aren't safe, and believe there's alot of crap going on in the realm of vaccination and in the medical community and the media community.

You know why there aren't many scientists who are against vaccines? Well, because when they are, they get fired, and awesome now we don't have to call them scientists any more.

>2) i never said Andrew Wakefield was jailed. But he did lose his medical license and has been discredited over and over again.

Again, discredited doesn't mean fairly discredited.

I can discredit Einstein all I want doesn't make him wrong.

>3) you lose all credibility if you bring up Andrew Wakefield in any anti-vax argumen

Well only if of course you believe that Andrew Wakefield was wrong. And even if he was, it still doesn't discredit my argument because that would be a fallacy of containment.. because something contains a false piece of information, doesn't mean that the rest is also false.

It's just an easy way for you to ignore and to rationalize not being reasonable.

>) not interested in reading any of your links. Are any of them links to credible peer-reviewed studies? If not, then don't waste your time posting them to me.

Why do you think that outbreaks of measles are concentrated around neighborhoods with a low % of immunizations, and incidence of outbreaks increases with a decrease in the vaccination rate?

Like, I would genuinely like to know why you think that might be. It's something that's happening right now in the real world.

The diversity is representative of the Danish population. So you concede there is no cause for concern among the Danish population. Excellent. Now we just need to walk you from this bizarre racial angle.

If you think race is a better predictor of autism risk factors than sex, smoking during pregnancy, family history of ASD diagnosis, head circumference at birth, weight at birth, method of birth delivery, and, vaccination status...then yous an idiot.

In the most conservative interpretation, even if we assume your hypothesis about race to have *some* merit, we can now rule out all medical, non-race, factors from influencing ASD development in association with vaccines. And by extension based on the Danish population we can confidently declare that anyone of caucasion descent also has no differential response, either.

emfcrco,Comment,">Yawn.

In your sleep deprivation it seems you completely forgot your operating hypothesis: differences in ethnicity ultimately lead to a differential ASD diagnostic outcome.

Congratulations! We have [data](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/addm-community-report/differences-in-children.html) on that. It doesn't support your hypothesis--that non-white ethnicities have higher ASD diagnosis. So we keep piling up the implausibility. You have to now plausibly explain why higher antibody titers or other unknown immune response factors to a vaccine lead to differential ASD diagnosis among races. And *then* you have to explain why in *your* link there is no difference among genders--which is a hallmark for differential ASD diagnosis. Oops, guess ya didn't read that after all.

So, yes, I'm curious: how would race, but not gender, impact ASD development according to the above link when this 1) doesn't fit epi data on ASD diagnosis among ethnicities; 2) doesn't fit gender epi data on ASD diagnosis? But we know the answer: you haven't thought about it and you don't care. You just bring up some random hair-brained idea to deal with your cognitive dissonance. The pattern has borne itself out twice in this thread alone.

>I'm ""caucasian"". I've also found out I have fairly recent genetic ties to subsaharan Africa.

Excellent--so this would *not* be a problem with the Danish study, as genetic factors can be cryptic and not adequately accounted for by simple race-binning. High five!

>That was a pretty big fuckup too, wasn't it? One in five europeans carrying a dormant gene for narcolepsy that the vaccine adjuvant just happened to trigger?

Uh oh, sounds like you don't know much about AS03, MF59, or the Pandemrix situation and that this is just a random distraction from the actual conversation you've so thoroughly lost. No worries--I'm used to having to fill you in on everything.

The Pandemrix association with narcolepsy appears to be a cryptic antigen site, not related to any of the adjuvants used in the pandemic vaccines. Read the [multi-country](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6404226/) assessment which looked at several AS03 and one MF59 vaccine, as well as the safety assessment of [AS03](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X19305225?via%3Dihub). 

Also, you don't seem to understand how genes work. The vaccine didn't trigger a ""dormant gene"". The virus, which the vaccine recapitulated specific antigenic sites, can apparently trigger autoimmune reaction in a small subset of people among a specific HLA type. I recommend hitting up wikipedia on [genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene) so you can get that under your belt.

eop9hih,Comment,">No more AS03 being used in Europe right now, though, is there?

Well, duh, it's an experimental adjuvant that isn't used in any vaccine excepting emergent circumstances and clinical trials. It's also not used in the US, either, because there isn't a need for it. It's just used for pandemic vaccines in emergent circumstances.

>You can spin it how you want. An interplay of vaccine and genetics really screwed these people.

There's no spin, just fact. But since you live and breathe off spin and lies, I'm not surprised you recognize a different consistency here. You've gone waaay off the beaten path because you don't know shit about immunology, ASD pathogenesis, or infectious disease. So you found that one discontinued vaccine increased the risk of narcolepsy/cataplexy in a subset of genetically disposed individuals and you're trying to run hard with it.

It has nothing to do with childhood vaccines, nothing to do with ASD, and likely nothing to do with AS03. That there was an association with the vaccine is incidental and due to the fact that it was, apparently, able to recapitulate the natural tendency of some circulating pandemic 2009 H1N1 strains to increase rates of narcolepsy/cataplexy. To repeat: **circulating H1N1 virus was correlated with increased narcolepys/cataplexy rates prior to vaccine campaigns in several countries**.

Cryptic antigen mimicry which is the presumed mechanism of action is likely at play in several diseases. If we can determine the B or T cell epitopes with cross reactivity these can be removed from the vaccine. As it currently stands, these epitopes were never determined. Nevertheless, you will still run to such edge cases with relatively small impacts on small incidence rates because this is how you behave when you've been cornered. You repeat this pattern over and over, much to the amusement of onlookers. 

>Maybe you should go back to playing with next year's flu vax formulation.

I don't make flu vaccines or any vaccine.

>You know, make it really work this time.

Nope.  There was a tiny subset in China in which there appeared to be some correlation between the virus and narcolepsy.  

No cases in Europe like that.  They were all associated with the vaccine, not the virus.

According to

https://www.autism-watch.org/news/lancet.shtml

In 2004, ten of the study's authors issued a ""retraction"" which stated: ""We wish to make it clear that in this paper no causal link was established between MMR vaccine and autism as the data were insufficient.""

So just how different is that from the studies conclusion? See for yourself - 

""We did not prove an association between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and the syndrome described. Virological studies are underway that may help to resolve this issue.

If there is a causal link between measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine and this syndrome, a rising incidence might be anticipated after the introduction of this vaccine in the UK in 1988...


....We have identified a chronic enterocolitis in children that may be related to neuropsychiatric dysfunction. In most cases, onset of symptoms was after measles, mumps, and rubella immunisation. Further investigations are needed to examine this syndrome and its possible relation to this vaccine.""

Isn't the 2004 ""retraction"" Saying the same thing as the study? Nothing was proved. 

The study was published in 1998.. It was retracted a very long time later. Why did it take so long? 

Some of the claims of fraudulent activities aim at Dr. Wakefield's payment to be a witness or a supposed link to an application for a vaccine patent. 
Have you seen how much money Dr Offit and Plotkin make from all the vaccines. They have the patent on the R in MMR yet they are often called as witness against Dr Wakefield or give expert witness for a news report.

To put it in perspective, 1 in 10,000 is the same probability of getting struck by lightning in your lifetime. (Howstuffworks.com) 

Proof: https://physiciansforinformedconsent.org/critical-calculation-error-in-background-information-for-hearing-on-vaccines-save-lives-what-is-driving-preventable-disease-outbreaks-on-march-5-2019/

Prior to the introduction of the measles vaccine in 1963, ‚Äúthere were an estimated 3 to 4 million people infected with measles in the United States, and as many as 500 related deaths each year,‚Äù which is correct. However, this computes to a number of deaths which, at most, is one in 6,000 (3,000,000 divided by 500). More precisely, between 1959 and 1962, about 400 measles deaths occurred among about 4,000,000 measles cases, which results in a one in 10,000 (0.01%) chance of a child dying from measles, not one in 500 or one in 1,000. By comparison, over 23,000 infant deaths occur every year in the U.S. and thus the chance of a child dying in his or her first year of life is currently one in 170 (0.6%)‚Äîthis is 60 times the risk of a child dying from measles in 1962, a time period when almost every child had measles by age 15.

The reason this calculation error unfortunately commonly occurs is because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes case-fatality rates based on the number of¬†reported¬†cases only. And, since it is estimated that nearly 90% of measles cases are benign and therefore¬†not reported¬†to the CDC, the widely publicized measles case-fatality rate is a 10-fold miscalculation.

Vaccine strain isn't the same as the pathogenic strain. This isn't scary for anyone except those undergoing chemotherapy and other immune-depleting situations.

>During the 2015 California measles outbreak, many suspected cases actually occurred in persons who were recently vaccinated.

[Wrong](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6406a5.htm?s_cid=mm6406a5_w):

>>Among the 110 California patients, 49 (45%) were unvaccinated; five (5%) had 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine, seven (6%) had 2 doses, one (1%) had 3 doses, 47 (43%) had unknown or undocumented vaccination status, and one (1%) had immunoglobulin G seropositivity documented, which indicates prior vaccination or measles infection at an undetermined time.

Which is entirely consistent with vaccination efficacy.

>194 measles virus sequences were collected in 2015, with 73 cases found to have actually been vaccine strain measles.

Wrong again:

>>The source of the initial Disney theme park exposure has not been identified. Specimens from 30 California patients were genotyped; all were measles genotype B3, which has caused a large outbreak recently in the Philippines, but has also been detected in at least 14 countries and at least six U.S. states in the last 6 months (1).

Vaccine strain is not capable of causing wild-type disease.

Impressive. You've convinced me fully. We should stop vaccinating.

Yep. Happened with smallpox, and from entire hemispheres with polio and measles. Did you forget that?

McNall wrote, ""During the measles outbreak in California in 2015, a large number of suspected cases occurred in recent vaccinees.

McNall contradicts that by explaining that vaccine strain reaction (rash & fever) is clinically indistinguishable from the natural disease. You need genotyping to confirm the origin and distinguish vaccine strain cases from wild-type cases.

So by you saying that vaccine strain measles is only scary for the immunocompromised, and CDC stating that the reaction of vaccine strain and wild strain is identical, it proves that the general public should NOT be worried about measles. It is a mild illness to everyone but, as you said, ""those undergoing chemotherapy and other immune-depleting  situations.""

&#x200B;

Also, thank you for showing me the 2004 Thimerosal study. You've uncovered something interesting.

The 1999 study is titled *Increased Risk of developmental neurologic impairment after high exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccine in first month of life.* It states children who received the Hep B at birth had an increase of 762% for autism, 498% for sleep disorders, and 206% for speech delays compared to children that did not receive the vaccine.

The conclusion: This analysis suggests that high exposure to ethylmercury from thimerosal-containing vaccines in the first month of life increases the risk of subsequent development of neurologic development impairment...

&#x200B;

Oddly, the 2004 continuation study is the exact opposite. Titled *Safety of Thimerosal-Containing Vaccines: A Two-Phased Study of Computerized Health Maintenance Organization Databases.*

In this ""Phase II"" study, they've re-analyzed the Phase I data and suddenly found no increased risks for autism or attention-deficit disorder.

*Conclusions.* No  consistent significant associations were found between TCVs and neurodevelopmental outcomes. **Conflicting results were found at different  HMOs for certain outcomes. For resolving the conflicting findings,  studies with uniform neurodevelopmental assessments of children with a  range of cumulative thimerosal exposures are needed.**

I have a feeling that you regard everything the CDC reports as unquestionably true. But even you might find this a bit sketchy:

\- In 1997, Congress mandated the FDA to complete a review of mercury in drugs and food.

\- In 1999, CDC conducted their study, found incredibly concerning data, and instead of making it public, they decided not to publish.

\- In 2001, the CDC removed or reduced thimerosal in all childhood vaccines because of safety concerns.

\- In 2004, they published the continuation study that suddenly found that thimerosal was safe all along. And to resolve this obvious conflict in data between Phase I & II, they suggested that more studies of children exposed to thimerosal were needed. Conveniently, thimerosal had already been removed...

It proves you don't know how to read. The outbreak in California was caused by the Phillipines strain as already referenced. What the paper you *just* referenced is talking about is the ability to discriminate between vaccine measles strains and pathogenic measles strains. Your source goes on to say:

>>Since approximately 5% of recipients of measles virus-containing vaccine experience rash and fever which may be indistinguishable from measles (9), it is very important to identify vaccine reactions to avoid unnecessary isolation of the patient, as well as the need for contact tracing and other labor-intensive public health interventions.

And the part you liked to leave out, because you are dishonest and in over your head:

>>Of the 194 measles virus sequences obtained in the United States in 2015, 73 were identified as vaccine sequences (R. J. McNall, unpublished data). 

>>Genotyping is used to confirm the origin of an outbreak and to exclude endemic circulation, but it is also the only way to distinguish vaccine strains from wild-type viruses. 

Those recent vaccinees were not infected with measles. They simply had a relatively common reaction to the vaccination and, due to proximity (locale and time) with an actual measles outbreak, were initial false-positives.

>McNall contradicts that by explaining that vaccine strain reaction (rash & fever) is clinically indistinguishable from the natural disease.

No they don't. How else, then, can the PCR test distinguish them if they are indistinguishable? How else, then, do public health authorities justify quarantine for those with measles rather than vaccination reactions? You know, like McNall says here:

>>During measles outbreak investigations, rapid detection of measles vaccine reactions is necessary to avoid unnecessary public health interventions.

And also in **the first line of the paper**:

>>During measles outbreaks, it is important to be able to rapidly distinguish between measles cases and vaccine reactions to avoid unnecessary outbreak response measures such as case isolation and contact investigations. 

>and CDC stating that the reaction of vaccine strain and wild strain is identical

They don't. Even in *your source* they are clearly distinguishable. The measles component is twice attenuated and not pathogenic. It can cause a rash and fever. It does not cause CNS damage, immune repertoire depletion, or SSPE--hallmarks of pathogenic measles.

Clinically indistinguishable means that when OBSERVING the patient, the PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS (rash & fever) can look the same in BOTH wild strain and vaccine strain measles.  

&#x200B;

>Vaccine strain isn't the same as the pathogenic strain. This isn't scary  for anyone except those undergoing chemotherapy and other immune-depleting situations.

True. They differ on a genetic level. But they share the common physical symptoms of rash & fever. You taught me that the pathogenic strain can cause further complications like SSPE. According to the CDC, severe complications are rare. Pneumonia is said to be 1 in 20. That doesn't look bad when compared to the MMR II pre-licensing studies that got released this week. The studies show 40-50% of kids got upper respiratory infections and gastro-intestinal disorders after the MMR vaccine. That's a harsh trade-off for a virus that causes rash & fever in the common person and then gives you lifelong immunity. Unless you're immunocompromised, no reason to be scared of wild measles.

Maybe entertain the possibility of primary & secondary vaccine failure. Or viral shedding from other recent vaccinees. Your faith in this vaccine is strong my friend. 

&#x200B;

Now the 1999 pilot. You got this wrong. And I'm the one that doesn't know how to read? 

>More data can do that. Weird how sample sizes work?

Actually they looked at less data. The 1999 unpublished pilot looked at 400,000 infants in the VSD. Phase I of the 2004 published study only looked at 124,170 infants in the VSD. 

>Yep. Bigger sample size.

Wrong again. In phase II, the most common disorders associated with exposure in phase I were re-evaluated among only 16,717 children.

It's so obvious that they reduced the sample size to make the links to autism, sleep disorders, learning disabilities and speech delays in the 1999 pilot statistically less significant. Then they reduced it again. Wow.  This is the same strategy Dr. William Thompson said he used with his team to bury the autism link during the famous 2004 MMR study. 

&#x200B;

Furthermore, there's a massive ethical issue with the 1999 study. If you're the CDC, and you find data that points to a 762% increase in autism after the Hep B shot, you have a duty to disclose that to the public. The CDC is the health protection agency of the nation. 

They had multiple options: 

Hold a press conference and re-assure the public that a further study would be done immediately. (This study analyzed existing data in the VSD so they could literally have done this study with a computer in a few hours). 

Remove the Hep B vaccine indefintely for non-risk newborns until further study was completed. Only administer it to at-risk newborns if their mother tested positive for Hep B during pregnancy. It is a vaccine for a sexually transmitted disease given on the first day of life. It would have made zero difference. 

Either option would would have built public trust and strengthened the vaccine program. 

Instead, they hid the study. Then 5 years later, they reduce the sample sizes and publish a study ""proving"" everything was safe all along. 

Fortunately for us, the FOIA request has exposed the unpublished 1999 pilot. Now, the CDC loses credibility, and confirms people's suspicions that it cares more about protecting pharma profits and the reputation of vaccines than children's health.

The rash and fever are not the total of the measles pathology. Literally the entire point of the paper you cite is to distinguish in a rapid way wild type pathogenic measles from reactions to MMR. It is literally the justification for their assay, funding, and paper that MMR does not and cannot cause wild-type measles pathology. *Some* aspects make the distinction difficult. Try as you might, they are not equivalent and your source makes that clear.

>Clinically indistinguishable means that when OBSERVING the patient, the PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS (rash & fever) can look the same in BOTH wild strain and vaccine strain measles.

Yes the FEVER and the RASH can BOTH be SIMILAR in wild type MEASLES or a REACTION to the MEASLES component of the MMR VACCINE. NOWHERE do the AUTHORS suggest THAT wild-type measles IS clinically identical IN consequence TO the measles VACCINE component. 

>True. They differ on a genetic level. But they share the common physical symptoms of rash & fever.

And they also don't share other pathologies, hence the distinction being important from a public heath standpoint. You keep ignoring this.

>You taught me that the pathogenic strain can cause further complications like SSPE. According to the CDC, severe complications are rare. Pneumonia is said to be 1 in 20.

Death is about 1-2 per 1000 for wild-type measles, as well as immune repertoire depletion, deafness, pneumonia you mention, encephahlitis you mention. This doesn't happen with the vaccine component.

>The studies show 40-50% of kids got upper respiratory infections and gastro-intestinal disorders after the MMR vaccine.

Link it if you want me to consider it in our discussion.

>That's a harsh trade-off for a virus that causes rash & fever in the common person

And would kill thousands annually unnecessarily, along with the sequelae we've mentioned previously. But, sure, let's equate increased risk of a cold with measles pathology.

>and then gives you lifelong immunity.

You can get lifelong immunity *and* avoid the disease with vaccines. Immunity isn't the goal--avoiding the disease and its ramifications is.

>Unless you're immunocompromised, no reason to be scared of wild measles.

We've literally mentioned excellent reasons, such as the unnecessary deaths of thousands and other bad sequelae. All of which has disappeared from the US due to vaccination. 

>Your argument is that these vaccinees were not infected with measles. They simply had the EXACT SAME PHYSICAL REACTION as the people that DID catch the measles at the SAME TIME & LOCATION of a measles outbreak?

That's not my argument--that's what your study says. They didn't have the exact same physical reaction, they had a fever and rash. They were not shedding measles virus, they were potentially shedding attenuated measles vaccine virus. They were not having a risk of pneumonia, encephalitis, or death. They were having an uncommon reaction to the vaccine strain.

>Maybe entertain the possibility of primary & secondary vaccine failure. Or viral shedding from other recent vaccinees. Your faith in this vaccine is strong my friend.

Vaccination failure exists. The solution is to titer and re-vaccinate, or rely on herd immunity.

As for shedding from recent vaccinees, they'd be shedding attenuated vaccine virus. Which, again, is not pathogenic.

There's no faith at play here.

>Now the 1999 pilot. You got this wrong. And I'm the one that doesn't know how to read?

Either unable or unwilling, yes.

>Actually they looked at less data. The 1999 unpublished pilot looked at 400,000 infants in the VSD. Phase I of the 2004 published study only looked at 124,170 infants in the VSD.

Ah, here's that inability to read again. Let's fact check this bit.

>>We assessed the risk for neurologic and renal impairment associated with past exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccine using automated data from the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD). VSD is a large linked database from four health maintenance organizations in Washington, Oregon and California, containing immunization, medical visit and demographic data on over 400,000 infants born between '91 and '97.

There are 400,000 infants in the VSD. That doesn't mean all were appropriate or selected for in their analysis. So you're already off base here. But it gets better.

>>A 2-phased retrospective cohort study was
conducted using computerized health maintenance organization (HMO) databases. Phase I screened for associations between neurodevelopmental disorders and thimerosal exposure among 124 170 infants who were born during
1992 to 1999 at 2 HMOs (A and B). In phase II, the most
common disorders associated with exposure in phase I
were reevaluated among 16 717 children who were born
during 1991 to 1997 in another HMO (C). Relative risks
for neurodevelopmental disorders were calculated per
increase of 12.5 g of estimated cumulative mercury exposure from TCVs in the first, third, and seventh months
of life

So, no, they didn't use a smaller sample size. The exact inclusion criteria of the abstract presented isn't known, since only the abstract has been saved. And, no, phase II doesn't use a smaller sample size or remove the first. It is a comparison of a different HMO investigating rates found in the first two HMOs. And there was no association. And, finally, this study (both phases) looks at the 1st, 3rd, and 7th month of life whereas the initial abstract is just about the first month.

This is also evident when you look at the sheer number of disorders found in the full paper's phase I as it clearly outnumbers the total of all disorders of the abstract. 

So my advice: work on that reading comprehension. You've got some words down, but the ability to interpret meaning is tripping you up.

>Wrong again. In phase II, the most common disorders associated with exposure in phase I were re-evaluated among only 16,717 children.

No, all associations and RR of significance in phase I were analyzed at a different site. It's not the ""most common"" but those with apparent RR of concern.

>It's so obvious that they reduced the sample size to make the links to autism, sleep disorders, learning disabilities and speech delays in the 1999 pilot statistically less significant.

How so? The sample size of the abstract isn't known. The paper has a combined sample size of 140,887. The significance of phase I isn't removed by addition of a *smaller* sample size. That makes no sense at all. Do you not understand how that makes no sense?

>Furthermore, there's a massive ethical issue with the 1999 study. If you're the CDC, and you find data that points to a 762% increase in autism after the Hep B shot, you have a duty to disclose that to the public. The CDC is the health protection agency of the nation.

Which they investigated. And found no apparent significance at different HMOs. And recommended further study with larger samples and consistent diagnostic criteria. In no way were the results buried.

>Here is an explanation of how I calculated the measles death rate (including the 1 in 250 estimate) 

Great, let's break that down.

>CDC lists a death rate up to 1 in 500, but mentions that before the vaccine there were thought to be 3-4 million cases and 500 deaths each year, which would be a 1 in 6,000-8,000 death rate 

There are three incongruous parts meshed together with one bad assumption:

1) The mortality rate of measles is ""up to 1:500""

2) Pre-1963, there were an estimated 3-4 million cases of measles annually

3) Pre-1963, there were 500 deaths annually

For the third point, this is, according to the CDC source, from reported measles deaths. This is not an estimate, it is an average value of actual, reported cases. This is true for pre-1963 era.

For the second, this is an estimate of the total measles morbidity annually prior to 1963. This is probably accurate for pre-1963 era, but comes loaded with a 25-33% error range, not including a particular confidence interval. 

For the first, the mortality rate is based on data from both before 1963 and after. This is derived from confirmed measles cases and confirmed measles deaths. Nuance is lost in the first point since you've lost the range, which is 1-2 per 1000. Additionally, this value is reported in an intuitive way (X per 1000) rather than the more scientifically meaningful way, a decimal number (2.0 per 1000; 0.63 per 1000). You can make the denominator increase or decrease 'large' amounts for relatively small movements in actual case fatality rates and with no or little meaningful statistical resolution between the two. 

And to belabor the point I've already made, you are comparing **estimated** morbidity with **known** mortality. That is apples to oranges. If you had an estimate of morbidity with an estimate of mortality, you could have at it. What's interesting, then, is that to get your 1:250 number you compare **known** cases with **known** mortality, not estimates. And this is further massaged by picking, presumably arbitrarily, 1994-2014. If we, also arbitrarily, include up to 1988 then we get a CFR of 0.0022 or roughly 1:450. If we just look at the outbreak of 1989-1991 we also get a CFR of 0.0022. If we just take the first five years of reported values starting at 1950--which has a combined 40 times case numbers than the entirety of 1988 onward--we get a CFR of 0.001 or roughly 1:970. Which rounds out a nice estimate of 0.001-0.002 or 1-2 per 1000. 

And yet in the first paragraph you have picked a *single range*--with no mind for data collection, statistical confidence, attack rate by age, or other extrapolation issues--while ignoring the repeatedly collected and congruent information which suggests this homebrewed estimate is wrong or not informative as packaged. 

But I appreciate you explaining how you calculated it. Vaxfact seems like a very dubious website, as an aside. I would like to repeat my caution that you stick to reputable sources.

You are killing your children by not vaccinating them. It may seem dangerous but without vaccines, your child could die in the blink of an eye.

I vaccinated my children because I agree with you.... in part.

>A vaccine is just a weaker harmless version of a virus

It is not 'just' that at all.

Vaccines also have hundreds of various chemicals and toxins (I have a list available if you're curious) added to them to help bind the virus to our body.

The immune system also has to fight the toxins and chemicals and sometimes, (very rarely I must add) these chemicals can cause a patient to have an allergic reaction, causing notably, autism, sickness and sometimes it's fatal.

I researched this long and hard before I decided ultimately, to vaccinate my children. 

I found that more people die of preventable diseases yearly than have ever died of vaccines to date. Statistically I couldn't take that risk.

I'm happy to say my family is healthy and well with absolutely no adverse side effects.

I have done my personal best in researching this issue and can confidentially send them out into the world knowing they won't catch the viruses they are vaccinated against. As a mother that is a comfort.

But please don't state things like ""it's just the virus"" it gives the antivaxers too much to argue against because it simply is not true.

md4t5p,95% effective is misleading.,"I don't know much about statistics, but the effectiveness rates I keep hearing about sound misleading.

The BioNTech study (as reported in New England Journal of Medicine) reports the vaccine as being 95% effective

[https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577?articleTools=true](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577?articleTools=true)

   That does not mean that 95% of those who take it will not get Covid 19.  Just ask anyone who argues with you what the absolute risk reduction is and they likely won't have anything to say.  Low absolute risk reductions mean the 95% is misleading at best.  

Explanation of relative vs absolute risk reduction:

[https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/32/suppl\_2/ii13/3056571](https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article/32/suppl_2/ii13/3056571)

[https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/11/26/peter-doshi-pfizer-and-modernas-95-effective-vaccines-lets-be-cautious-and-first-see-the-full-data/](https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2020/11/26/peter-doshi-pfizer-and-modernas-95-effective-vaccines-lets-be-cautious-and-first-see-the-full-data/)

&#x200B;

In this trial only 154 fewer people caught covid in the vaccine group, which contained over 18,000 subjects.

**BNT162b2**  Vaccine n = 18,198 -- 8 cases

			Placebo n = 18,325 -- 162 cases

**8** (1 severe)

**162** (9 severe)

ARControl = 162/18,325 = 0.008840

ARTreatment = 8/18,198 = 0.000044

ARC ‚Äì ART \* 100 tells you absolute risk reduction  

(0.008840 ‚Äì 0.000044) \* 100 = 0.8796%     

With such a low absolute risk reduction it is almost useless, preventing 154 cases for every \~18,000 people vaccinated.   

Also, The WHO is being sued by Dr. Reiner Fullmich over this.

The problem with vaccines is that they have become something that is, at the very least, irrational to even ask questions about. Even if we put that aside, mandatory vaccination is worthy of opposition because it presumes that people are born faulty and do not deserve to be a part of (or that they even pose a threat to) the society until they have been ‚Äúput right‚Äù by vaccination.

The whole life cycle of a vaccine is riddled with questionable incentives from the start. Manufacturers get a lot of money and are not held responsible for any harm that it might cause to those that get it. In fact, it is in their interest to preserve ‚Äúthe threat‚Äù that so many people are being vaccinated against.

The doctors and patients are in the same boat. Physicians risk their entire careers by simply showing hesitation towards vaccines and their patients are being ridiculed, threatened and labeled as ‚Äúanti-vaxxers‚Äù, ‚Äúnutjobs‚Äù and other pejorative names if they refuse to take the vaccine.

Every ‚Äúconversation‚Äù about this (and I‚Äôm yet to find a meaningful one on Reddit) is filled with ‚ÄúSource?‚Äù and pointless linking to studies of choice on both sides. You don‚Äôt need to be pro or against vaccines to talk about whether they should be *mandatory* and what are the implications of that.

The irony is that vaccine uptake would surely be higher if they weren‚Äôt compulsory (as they currently are in many countries). Making them mandatory messes up with incentives of everyone involved and builds distrust. Not to mention that it opens the doors to forcing people to other measures that infringe their rights to their bodily autonomy.

I know Reddit is basically choose-your-circlejerk but that doesn‚Äôt lead to anything meaningful.",anti_vaxxers

The US had a crisis in the 80s with people suing vaccine manufacturers because of this, and now has a list of prescribed financial remedies.

Life isn't a series of black-and-white choices. Get the vaccine for your baby, and have a tiny of them having a bad reaction. Don't get the vaccine for your baby, and have no risk of getting an infection because everyone else vaccinates their babies so there's herd immunity. Now we are at the point where there isn't herd immunity for diseases that were almost eradicated including measles because too many anti-vaxxers don't want their kid to be the one with the bad reaction, even if that means the baby could die from measles instead. 

To me, the choice is obvious: vaccinate. But others evaluate risk differently. They don't know anyone who died from a preventable childhood disease, but they see a meme like this about a baby who died from a vaccine. So they make the choice based on emotion and hope that enough people make the opposite choice to preserve herd immunity so they can free ride.",anti_vaxxers

This isn't about Reddit. No one uses Reddit as evidence, it's just a place to talk. And who on earth is this guy you're talking about... Sounds like you made him up.

>I'm just saying, I'd personally trust a doctor's who have spent many years of their life researching pathogens and how to prevent spreading them m

Doctors don't research pathogens and vaccines, scientists do, pathologists do, immunologist do. Thing is, scientists work for pharmacueitcal companies.. and universities which are largely funded by pharmaceutical companies.

Plus, doctors get bonuses for vaccination records, big ones too. 40,000$ in USA for each 122 given. (Number might be slightly off I can't remember) 

>thinks the government is out to ""kill us all"" or to ""put microchips in us to track us all the time"". 

No I don't. I think the government is blackmailed by pharmaceutical lobbyists to make pharma look good, so that pharma can make less safe and quicker vaccines that make them more cash.

Also I don't believe the microchips are that big of a concern compared to health hazards.

 I've seen many people on reddit site false information (I don't have a username as of right now) who claimed that viruses can't spread because they aren't alive and didn't provide a source or adequate reasoning for it. 

>about Google is not valid because you can go away from your phone, you can't get away from tracking if it's in your arm.

The flaw with the microchips is that 1, Google already has so much data about you (location data, data about your interests, etc. I got this information from a book that I'm reading called ""The Age of Surveillance Capitalism"") and 2, it is impossible as of right now to fit a microchip into the diameter of a needle and have it still be able to have GPS tracking and identification of who the chip is in. Also, why would the government even need to locate you at all times. It only makes sense if you are a felon, but they already do that. And there is literally nothing else that a microchip can really do, it can't scrape your brain activity because even if it were to fit in the diameter of a needle, it's too small to get adequate readings of brain activity. 
 
>less safe and quicker vaccines that make them more cash.

If you are referring to the COVID vaccine, sure it was developed quicker than vaccines before it, but you have to realize that COVID is a disease that have affected us so much, and obviously the pharmaceutical companies would try to get the vaccine out quickly. But they still did adequate testing of it and are mostly safe. Sure you can argue that Astro-Zeneca is having the blood clot issue but that is only affecting a very slim amount of the population, 7 people have been affected out of 20 million doses in the UK (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/covid-19-vaccine-astrazeneca-benefits-still-outweigh-risks-despite-possible-link-rare-blood-clots). 

>Doctors don't research pathogens and vaccines, scientists do, pathologists do, immunologist do. Thing is, scientists work for pharmacueitcal companies.. and universities which are largely funded by pharmaceutical companies.

Microchips cannot fit into the standard diameter of a needle, and if you really wanted to see that there is no microchip, you can literally just ask the doctor or nurse who is giving you the vaccine to show you the vile before they use it, assuming that you can see, you would be able to see a microchip in there.",anti_vaxxers
grqkh6w,Comment,">But government organizations like the FDA test the vaccines to verify that they work as well?

They do ""verify"" them but they are so bribed and cooperative with the pharmaceutical companies that they aren't very fair or bias free and also sometimes do actually lie and manipulate data to please big companies. 

Also the CDC has its own vaccine patents and makes billions from them yearly.

And, it's not just a financially motivated endeavour it's also political and philosophical, which means there's more biases even with government. Government aren't necessarily bias free!

And whether or not they are verified by government the fact still is that the studies are not top standard or even remotely close to it.

>I was referring to the amount of people who have had the blood clot issues in the UK. Also, COVID-19 has killed WAY more people than the vaccine has. The benefits outweigh the harm. 

The vaccine is new, we cannot identify it's long term outcomes yet. The thing is, I'm not saying vaccines for covid aren't useful, I just think we should give it to over 40s and people who are a bit vulnerable rather than just any old 20 year old. It's not one size fits all!

Covid is also not proven to cause as many deaths as it has been claimed to. The methods used to determine covid mortality is very flawed and means that many people will get written down as covid victims frim death from other causes just because they had positive test results.

>Microchips cannot fit into the standard diameter of a needle, and if you really wanted to see that there is no microchip, you can literally just ask the doctor or nurse who is giving you the vaccine to show you the vile before they use it, assuming that you can see, you would be able to see a microchip in there.

That's not a lot.

Remember the flu kills about that many each year anyway. 

And the common cold causes about half that. 

Also remember, most of the world is unhealthy, overweight, obese and cancerous (lack of better term).

If you're healthy, below 40, and you haven't got underlying predisposition, you're pretty much as likely to die from covid as you are to die in a train crash.

Can you look up terrain theory, it's a theory that explains disease in terms of the host's health, not the diseases morbidity.

1 million people is not a lot? Also, according to WHO, there is an estimated 290 000-650 000 influenza related deaths worldwide. So basically half of the number that I produced, or less than a quarter of the official number. 

>If you're healthy, below 40, and you haven't got underlying predisposition, you're pretty much as likely to die from covid as you are to die in a train crash.

The main goal of the pandemic response was to reduce hospitalizations so that people don't have to die. The main reason that people died from COVID is because they weren't able to get access to the proper treatment that they needed (mainly ICU capacity).",anti_vaxxers

The reason why I ask is that based on the article provided those are just report and are yet to be confirmed by any major health agency so I'll rather wait until a full investigation is done to determined if they're any links between the AstraZeneca vaccine and the formation of blood clots.

However, while a country have EVERY right to suspend vaccination rollouts due to concerns (as what they did in the UK due to the Pfizer/Biontech vaccine before resuming), I can't stop but be extremely disappointed by the response the government takes regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine as those would only contribute to vaccine alarmism as well as empowered and embolden the anti-vaxx community to cast doubt on not only the AstraZeneca vaccine but all COVID-19 vaccines reducing confidence in them even more which as a pro-vaxx is what worried me to the core.

gqzl322,Comment,"Theres a stark difference between being uncertain of the efficacy of a vaccine, and out right denying their function and what is done to make them. Generally, in fact I'd be willing to say about 100% of the time, anyone that is uncertain about a vaccine, will actually look into what was done for it. The potential effects it might have had on people that have used it, and the liklihood of any negatives happening.

Meanwhile, an out right antivaxer will completely deny the validity of a vaccine, and sometimes even claim the science that is behind the manufacturing one are absolite bunk, and have no way of backing up the screaming that they keep doing to the sky about it.

There are some people that will even try to dodge the antivaxer label by claiming they are, ""skeptical"" or try to place themselves amongst the unsure that are doing their homework, only to present the usual flimsy evidences expected of an antivaxer when they let the mask slip even a little bit.

If anyone that was, ""antivax"" would drop their guard for even a few minutes and actually pay attention to the sciences and explanations and stop listening to the Facebook Moms, Conspiracy Theorists, and self proclaimed ""experts"" that don't even have proper credentials or sources to back up their, ""studies"" then they would quickly stop being antivax as they'd realize just how ridiculous they've been.

gqzii2k,Comment,fair enough.,anti_vaxxers
gr7894w,Comment,"First of all, you make a great point regarding scientific fact and scientific consensus. Solid points for that. 

I am a scientist, but not an immunologist, so I am far from an expert on this, however I will point out this important bit of information that‚Äôs missing from your discussions: the effectiveness of a vaccine does depend on the number of people vaccinated. 

Consider that the public had a lot more trust, in general, in scientists and doctors 50+ years ago, so when the recommendations were to vaccinate, people did. Most of the population did. As a result we basically eradicated diseases such as measles or polio. Today however there‚Äôs a lot more scepticism about science, doctors etc, so a lot more of the population is choosing not to get vaccinated, and we are seeing a lot of diseases such as measles starting to return. 

So finally, the reason that a lot of governments are taking drastic steps such as not allowing unvaccinated kids access to public schools is because your choice does not only affect you, but others as well. It‚Äôs like choosing to drink then drive home. If you hit a tree and kill yourself as a consequence of your choice, so be it. But if instead of a tree you hit another car, well your choice to drink and drive could have serious consequences to others. Keep questioning the science. Keep challenging the norms. That‚Äôs how progress is made. And always consider the credibility of the source of your information.",anti_vaxxers
grbnnrr,Comment,"I can't speak for the poster of whom you ask this important question. But by refusing vaccine, folks  demonstrate a level of selfishness and lack of empathy that is not how we as a people have traditionally treated our fellow citizens.",anti_vaxxers
grxwpb9,Comment,"Yeah, well for one it‚Äôs not FDA approved. It‚Äôs only being distributed on a conditional emergency basis. Scientists have been working on the vaccine for over 20 years and they‚Äôve been pushing for it to be approved for years but has never been approved because it‚Äôs proven not to be safe or effective. Also, it does not keep you from spreading the virus to others or contribute to any herd immunity. Many people are getting the vaccination for convenience because they want to get back to ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù but the vaccine is only addressing one strain of the virus so those vaccinated can still contract the other strains that are circulating and other strains that have yet to be developed. 

I have multiple reasons against both popular vaccines. The Johnson and Johnson injects a spike protein (COVID mimic) that permanently binds to the surface of your cells. Your body can actually create antibodies to this protein and render the vaccination useless. Additionally, the protein could begin to attack healthy cells in your body similar to an autoimmune disease. Another reason I am against this vaccine is because it relies on harvesting cells from aborted fetuses. This is just a personal non-scientific conflict of mine. 

The mederna vaccine, on the other hand, is a different story. This is vaccine works by injecting unstable (must be kept at VERY low temps to be effective but then is injected into a warm human body?) genetic material that travels to the ribosomes of the cells and codes for the spike protein (same protein as Johnson and Johnson). The problem that I have with this is that the efficacy of the vaccine relies on the process of translation and protein synthesis. If the mRNA injected is unstable, it could lead to the body creating a faulty protein and who knows what effects this could have on our bodies. You can also never turn of the production of this protein because the mRNA never goes away (Trojan horse method). It can weaken our responses to new strains of Covid. Also, the unstable mRNA is encased in PEG (polyethylene glycol) and another lipid casing around the entire entity. These three things have never been tested together in humans and have not been proven to be safe in the body. No toxicity tests have been conducted so we have no idea what they all could do in the body.


On a personal note, I have a scary suspicion about these vaccines because if you google something like ‚Äúwhy not to take the vaccine‚Äù you will only find links on sites telling you why it‚Äôs safe and that you should take it. All the videos that I‚Äôve watched about the negatives of the vaccines have been taken down by YouTube. People are being silenced while there are over 25,000 adverse effects of the vaccines and people are dying from the vaccine and we are STILL being pushed to take the vaccine. Doctors, the president, our employers are pushing us to take something that‚Äôs not been proven to work, not proven to be safe, and they‚Äôre silencing those that raise concerns about the vaccine. It‚Äôs pretty scary.",anti_vaxxers

For example, the number of children counted without vaccination (the n value) was roughly five times higher in table 2b compared to the vaccinated children despite the fact that 90 percent of children in the U.s. were vaccinated in the U.s. not to mention, no real analytics are explained thoroughly in the methods section besides we used this software to do that.

Further more, the percentage of autism cases for each group in the provided table was 0.7 percent compared to 0.35 percent of children, which sure, is twice as likely, except given the sample size when compared to a larger population is statistically irrelevant ( that is, not important, but simply isn't properly representative of the larger population.) 

Now, going back to the first article, I did read in context of the thread. You claimed that he was wrong, autism was not caused by genetics. Yet the article doesn't outright say that. It says that environmental factors should be taken into consideration. Ironically, the article also says no ethnic groups were found to have any difference, yet the second article you gave claims that ""the black race has been shown to be associated with an increase risk of autism."" As well as a four fold increase in boys compared to girls. The two contradict each other.

Finally, I rechecked the links. They do work, the site must've been down for maintenance, as I was blocked due to a bad gateway.",anti_vaxxers

Secondly, those incidents are caused by bad science or bad business practices, much like the infamous german pregnancy medication.

With vaccines you're incurring an immediate risk in order to minimize a hypothetical risk.

It's a good thing you don't work in the economics sector, because with ass-backwards logic like this, whatever you'd touch would surely fail spectacularly.

Yeah, there is a feedback loop in the medical sector between pharmaceuticals, hospitals, and insurance companies, but there is one large issue with your crazy ass conspiracy, and it is as I said before, if a vaccine doesn't work, there is backlash. A lot of backlash. If it was found out that the Pfizer vaccine didn't work and instead, made you sicker, which evidence suggests the opposite, that company would easily go under, and anyone found to be supporting them would be under fire. It's way too obvious to sustain. The reason insurance companies get away with it because their methods are subtle and not alot of people know how it works. 

Finally, changing your DNA, what a joke. You clearly have no actual understanding of how a vaccine works, captain of the tinfoil hat squad. The vaccine is and mRNA based vaccine. It's not even capable of recombination with DNA because of the way basic cell machinery works. It has to reverse transcriptase, so it can turn into DNA, therefore, that little comment makes you look like the biggest dumbass to roam the internet.

And one more thing i missed from your original post., vaccines help fight an infection. They don't necessarily prevent an infection altogether. You can have the vaccine and still shed viral load, hence the need to mask up and social distance dispute getting the vaccine, further showing your ignorance of the subject.",anti_vaxxers

If you where afraid that the MMR and another vaccine caused autism that has been proven false in multiple studies world wide.

As for the mRNA vaccine there is no virus in it. It is a set of instructions given to your sells to produce the antigen protein found on the wall of the virus. Your body sees this and says hey you don‚Äôt belong. Your immune system kicks into full gear and starts producing antibodies. As for the fever and sickness you feel that‚Äôs the other part of your immune system just going to work trying to kill the antigens with heat.

Just recently during a conversation with my brother in law, the husband and I learned that she was eligible for early vaccination due to being high risk near the end of last year. 

Her daughter denied her of that opportunity because it went against the daughter's ""*religious beliefs.*"" Her daughter actually works in the medical industry (not a doctor) so she's well informed about diseases and vaccinations. Or we assumed so.

We can't say for sure that covid really killed her, but it certainly didn't help with her physical state.

It‚Äôs been exhausting to find doctors who can help, and I‚Äôve been dismissed by so many health professionals. At the same time, I‚Äôve had a handful of doctors who have changed my freaking LIFE with their insight and medical intervention.

I doing mostly better now, but still struggling with food / digestive related issues. It‚Äôs hard to find a traditional doctor who will take these things seriously, so I‚Äôve taken this aspect of my health into my own hands while I wait to see a specialist who came highly recommended from one of the few doctors I trust. In this waiting period, I‚Äôve enrolled in a few root cause type programs online. The changes I‚Äôve seen by implementing these programs have been SUPER promising so far. I feel like I‚Äôm getting my life back! And I‚Äôm fully, well, ALMOST fully bought into the lifestyle choices these people are promoting based on my results thus far.

Why only *almost* fully bought in? You may have guessed it! Today I discovered the people behind these programs are hardcore ANTI VAXX! I honestly had a moment today where I just felt like, ‚Äúshit, if they‚Äôre right about all this food stuff..... what if they‚Äôre right about vaccines too?!‚Äù It was a fleeting moment, and I‚Äôm actually due for my second dose of that sweet, sweet Pfizer shot in a week (hell yeah!!!!!!!!!) but it still got me wondering - does anyone else struggle with this?

gqbjs58,Comment,"So, full disclosure. Shit doctors exist, and it sucks that you apparently ran the full gamut with them. It is good that you've found a few good doctors you can turn to though, keep those good ones in your life. The good doctors genuinely do go into their field to improve other peoples lives as well as advance the science they practice.

It's also good that you found nutritionists that have diet and health plans that seem to work for you. However... your nutritionists aren't doctors. At least not medical doctors. Not in the sense that one would expext a medical doctor to be like. Your nutritionists know what they're talking about when it comes to balancing your diet and likely know good exercise regimes that can and likely will help. 

But when it comes to something like a disease, especially one with potential lethality like the one people are taking Pfizer for, they know about as much as any laymen out there. They know as much as you or me might know. If they're antivax like you say, then they likely know even less then you or me and will even toss any truthful statements about vaccines right out the window. Don't outright drop them if their health plans are working for you. But take anything they might say regarding vaccines with a grain of salt, if not ignore those statements out right.

If you're truly unsure about the vaccines, consult your actual doctors about them.

 Lets get specific here. Has he spent 10 years studying and understanding mRNA vaccines? As far as I'm aware, its as brand new to him as it is to anyone else.

In my experience, most of the antivax community aren't ""Karen's"" as often portrayed or even intellectually lacking, they're vulnerable people who have been misinformed and taken advantage of. Making fun of them, calling them names, insulting their intelligence, etc. just alienates them further making them less likely to listen to reason. 

I'd instead reccomend becoming informed on the common antivax talking points, keep a handful of well researched sources and know where/how to find more reliable information. And finally approach and start a conversation with compassion and a level head. Let them air their concerns and address them calmly and one at a time. Think of yourself as convincing someone you love to leave a cult (which it very much is), it won't work for everyone, and it usually won't work the first time, but you're at least providing an open pathway to reason and understanding. 

Definitely not saying any of this is easy, having a loved one become antivax is painful and disappointing. It's not dissimilar to trying to address a loved ones alcoholism or addiction issues. But saying things like ""fuck with anti vaxx retards"" is only going to further alienate people who might have been willing to listen in other circumstances :)",anti_vaxxers

I studied harder than ever before,  about subjects I never thought I'd have to. I thought I knew loneliness before,  but, not at all like I do now. And I'm finally showing signs of aging! Lol.

gprtfwx,Comment,"Well. Sitting down and talking would be really a good first step.   
A thing that is always really helpfull is asking your local doctor for advice if you need any information or at least some arguments for that conversation. One thing I noticed from your descriptions is that your aunt is scared for your cousins health..  
In that case I would suggest to start from the very bottom of the problem, asking why they think it's that dangerous, what their concerns are etc. Like digging into the root of the problem. Maybe asking as well why they could be so sure of the fact that vaccines hurt people. I can assure you, most of the time it's literally the fear of the unknown, people don't understand how vaccines work, that why they are scared and believe it could harm them (tbh I don't blame them, I would be sceptical too if I would not do my research)   
All it takes are some good arguments and valid research, convincing somebody is not easy.. I really hope you can convince your family to change their mind so for their own health.  


Worst case scenario, take your cousin yourself to the doctors for shots. I wish you luck on convincing them. :)",anti_vaxxers

This is a first of its kind vaccine, using mrna, and under Operation Warpeed the creation was able to bypass and streamline some of the same standards a traditional vaccine goes through. So being there is not significant data showing what, if any, long-term effects might exist.
