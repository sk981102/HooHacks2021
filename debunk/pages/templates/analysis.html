			<h2>Data Collection </h2><br>
			<span class="byline">From different subreddits that talk about
			vaccines, we were able to collect data about people's concern
				. The subreddits include : <br><br>

				r/VaccineMyths<br>
				r/AntiVaxxers <br>
				r/vaxxhappened <br>
				r/TrueAntiVaccination <br>

			<h2>Sentiment Analysis</h2><br>
			<span class="byline"> First, we were curious to see what were people's sentiment about the vaccination process.
				Are there a lot of unrest? Are what people saying objective? Are there a lot of negative emotions involved in
				the language?
				<br><br>
			</span>
			<img src="{% static 'images/sentiment.png' %}" alt="figure 1" style="width:60%;height:60%;"><br>
			<span class="byline"><br>
				The model was trained on TextBlob to gain sentiments.
				The polarity ranges from -1 to 1 - -1 being most negative and 1 being most positive. The subjectivity
				ranges from 0 to 1 - 0 being the least subjective and 1 being the most subjective. People were quite
				subjective when discussing vaccines. From the distribution, we can see that there are general normal distribution
				from both positivity and subjectivity.

			<img src="{% static 'images/sentiment2.png' %}" alt="figure 2" style="width:60%;height:60%;"><br>
			<span class="byline"><br>
				We tried to analyze if different communities (subreddits) exhibit different qualities in terms of positivity and
				subjectivity. However, the distribution across all subreddits, the distribution seemed to be similar.
				This was quite surprising that vaccination is quite a heated subject in this time, yet people
				are trying to maintain subjectivity when discussing the matter.

			<h2>Topic Modeling</h2><br>
			<span class="byline"> Now that we have seen how people feel about vaccine in the online community. We wanted to
				see what are the main concerns of the people. Utilizing gensim's LDA model, we were able to extract some of the
				key topics that the communities were discussing online.
				<br><br>
			</span>
			<br>
			<img src="{% static 'images/topic2.png' %}" alt="figure 4" style="width:60%;height:60%;"><br>
			<br>
			<span class="byline"> It occurred that many feared vaccination may be the cause of autism and cancer.
				Also, many of the keywords and topics were related to children. As parents it is natural for them to
				worry about the well being, and many seems to be concerned about giving vaccination to their children.
				There were also some fundamental distrust in the government, researches, and clinical trials. Those
				concerns should be addressed.

				Because the global pandemic, many of the Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers' names were discussed. Namely, Pfizer
				and AZ, whether taking one of the other is better for the people. Also, a lot about fever and various
				covid side-effects were discussed widely.
				<br><br>
			</span>
			<span class="byline"> These topics were used to create the main part of the survey. It was fascinating to
				see the variety of topics in the reddit community.
